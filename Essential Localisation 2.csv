EVTDESC14120651;It was only a matter of time before this would have happened. Government officials have spent months trying to play down the threat of the viral epidemic ravaging through $COUNTRY$ so the natural consequence of this is reduced awareness for cleanliness and few good practices to avoid infection being adopted by the staff in the $MONARCHTITLE$'s Office. The media and opposition members of parliament have tried in vain to persuade the government to change course but to no avail. Today, the $MONARCHTITLE$ has tested positive for the virus that is currently ravaging through $COUNTRY$. How he got it will always remain a mystery as there are simply too many staff shuffling in and out of the $MONARCHTITLE$'s Office. The $MONARCHTITLE$ is however confident that he will not be taken out by the virus. With the nation's best doctors at his disposal, he would likely survive though there is always a small chance something might happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007303;During the Indonesian struggle for independence (1945-1949), the capital of the republic was moved several times - prompted by political and military emergency - as the seat of the republic in exile during the war. The capital moved from Jakarta to Yogyakarta (1946-1948) and then to Bukittinggi (1948-1949) as the seat of the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia. By 1949, the national capital of the republic was returned to Jakarta. During Sukarno's presidency, Jakarta was established and developed as the capital of the new republic. In 1957, Sukarno laid the foundation and street grid layout of Palangkaraya as a new planned capital of Central Kalimantan province. Sukarno however, foresaw the new city as the possible new national capital in the future. The vast available area and its geographic location in the centre of the archipelago was the main advantage of the city. Nevertheless, Sukarno seemed to favour Jakarta instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12280021;The 1954 to 1959 phase of the Vietnam War was the era of the two nations. Coming after the First Indochina War, this period resulted in the military defeat of the French, a 1954 Geneva meeting that partitioned Vietnam into North and South, and the French withdrawal from Vietnam, leaving the Republic of Vietnam regime fighting a communist insurgency with USA aid. During this period, North Vietnam recovered from the wounds of war, rebuilt nationally, and accrued to prepare for the anticipated war. In South Vietnam, Ngo ?inh Di?m consolidated power and encouraged anti-communism. This period was marked by U.S. support to South Vietnam before Gulf of Tonkin, as well as communist infrastructure-building.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500840;On 25 June 1950, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of South Korea, with UN Security Council Resolution 82. The Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power, had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the Taiwanese Republic of China and not the mainland People's Republic of China held a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June President Truman ordered US air and sea forces to help South Korea. On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the US of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500810;On 20 August 1950, Premier Zhou Enlai informed the UN that "Korea is China's neighbor... The Chinese people cannot but be concerned about a solution of the Korean question". Thus, through neutral-country diplomats, China warned that in safeguarding Chinese national security, they would intervene against the UN Command in Korea. President Truman interpreted the communication as "a bald attempt to blackmail the UN", and dismissed it. Mao ordered that his troops should be ready for action by the end of August. Stalin, by contrast, was reluctant to escalate the war with a Chinese intervention. On 1 October 1950, the day that UN troops crossed the 38th Parallel, the Soviet ambassador forwarded a telegram from Stalin to Mao and Zhou requesting that China send five to six divisions into Korea, and Kim Il-sung sent frantic appeals to Mao for Chinese military intervention. At the same time, Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces themselves would not directly intervene. After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October, attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011904;On the late morning of 8 July 1994, Kim Il-sung collapsed from a sudden heart attack at his residence in Hyangsan, North Pyongan. After the heart attack, Kim Jong-il ordered the team of doctors who were constantly at his father's side to leave, and arranged for the country's best doctors to be flown in from Pyongyang. After several hours, the doctors from Pyongyang arrived, but despite their efforts to save him, Kim Il-sung died later that day at the age of 82. Kim Il-sung's death resulted in nationwide mourning and a ten-day mourning period was declared by Kim Jong-il. His funeral was on July 17, 1994 in Pyongyang and was attended by hundreds of thousands of people who were flown into the city from all over North Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011905;The North Korean famine was a period of mass starvation together with a general economic crisis from 1994 to 1998 in North Korea. The famine stemmed from a variety of factors. Economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support caused food production and imports to decline rapidly. A series of floods and droughts exacerbated the crisis. The North Korean government and its centrally planned system proved too inflexible to effectively curtail the disaster. Estimates of the death toll vary widely. Out of a total population of approximately 22 million, somewhere between 240,000 and 3,500,000 North Koreans died from starvation or hunger-related illnesses, with the deaths peaking in 1997.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011906;Kim Jong-il was a North Korean politician who served as the second Supreme Leader of North Korea from 1994 to 2011. He led North Korea from the 1994 death of his father Kim Il-sung, the first Supreme Leader until his own death in 2011, when he was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-un. Kim ruled North Korea as a repressive and totalitarian dictatorship. Kim assumed supreme leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies, which brought a famine. While the famine had ended by the late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure. Kim strengthened the role of the military by his Songun ("military-first") policies, making the army the central organiser of civil society. After his death, Kim was designated the "Eternal General Secretary" of the WPK and the "Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission", in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead members of the Kim dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8015100;In July 1949, in order to prevent Chinese Communist Party-sponsored agitation in political Tibet, the Tibetan government expelled the (Nationalist) Chinese delegation in Lhasa. Both the PRC and their predecessors the Kuomintang (ROC) had always maintained that Tibet was a part of China. The PRC also proclaimed an ideological motivation to liberate the Tibetans from a theocratic feudal system. The People's Liberation Army crossed the Jinsha River on 6 or 7 October 1950 and defeated the Tibetan army by 19 October. Instead of continuing with the military campaign, China asked Tibet to send representatives to Beijing to negotiate an agreement. The Dalai Lama believes the draft agreement was written by China, and Tibetan representatives were not allowed to suggest any alterations. China did not allow the Tibetan representatives to communicate with the Tibetan government in Lhasa. The Tibetan delegation was not authorised by Lhasa to sign, but ultimately submitted to pressure from the Chinese to sign anyway, using seals which had been specifically made for the purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015101;In 1949, seeing that the Communists were gaining control of China, the Kashag expelled all Chinese connected with the Chinese government, over the protests of both the Kuomintang and the Communists. Tibet was its own de facto country before 1951 but both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) have maintained China's claim to sovereignty over Tibet. The Chinese Communist government led by Mao Zedong, which came to power in October, lost little time in asserting a new PRC presence in Tibet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013802;On October 1, 1955, PRC leader Mao Zedong designated Xinjiang a "Uyghur Autonomous Region", creating a regionwide Uyghur identity which overtook Uyghurs' traditionally local and oasis-based identities. Although the Soviet Union initially suppressed the publications of its past Uyghur studies programs, after the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, it revived its Uyghur studies program as part of an "ideological war" against China. Uyghur nationalist historian Turghun Almas and his book Uyghurlar (The Uyghurs) and Uyghur nationalist accounts of history were galvanised by Soviet stances on history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013805;In the late summer of 1949, the People's Liberation Army drove into the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province and pressed toward Xinjiang. At the time, Xinjiang was ruled by a coalition government based in Dihua (now Urumqi), which comprised Chinese Nationalists (KMT) and representatives from the former Second East Turkestan Republic (ETR), a regime founded with the support of the Soviet Union in the Three Districts in northwestern Xinjiang during the Ili Rebellion in 1944 and then disbanded in 1946. Under the coalition government which ruled Xinjiang from 1946 to 1949, the KMT controlled most of the province and leaders of the former ETR retained autonomy in the Three Districts. In the fall of 1949, the Chinese Communists reached separate agreements with the political leadership of the KMT and the Three Districts. The Chinese Communists persuaded the KMT provincial and military leadership to surrender. The Soviet Union induced the leaders of the former ETR to accede to the Chinese Communists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC20201800;Theocracy is a form of government in which a deity of some type is recognised as the supreme ruling authority, giving divine guidance to human intermediaries that manage the day-to-day affairs of the government. As $COUNTRY$ aspires to be a theocratic government, a constitutional provision to give effect to this was promulgated. Under the Constitution of $COUNTRY$, the nation is to be governed by religious clerics. This is to ensure that the religious way of life is maintained in the nation and protected from the forces of secularisation. As such, the composition of the Executive branch must always be packed with traditionalist, religious politicians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC20201801;$COUNTRY$'s hybrid political system is sui generis, it encompasses both elements of democracy and theocracy. The constitution blends the liberal notion of popular sovereignty with the  rule  of  the religious jurisconsult. It establishes appointed institutions dominated by the clergy, such as the office of the Leader and the Guardian Council, while stipulating four tiers of popularly elected institutions: president, parliament, local councils, and the Assembly of Experts. An election is held approximately every 5 years and the electable parties are only traditionalist, conservative and centrist ones. Pop majority ideology will determine which party will win the election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80114301;On 26 October 1967, twenty-six years into his reign as Shah ("King"), he took the ancient title Shahanshah ("Emperor" or "King of Kings") in a lavish coronation ceremony held in Tehran. He said that he chose to wait until this moment to assume the title because in his own opinion he "did not deserve it" up until then. He is also recorded as saying that there was "no honour in being Emperor of a poor country" (which he viewed Iran as being until that time).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80114302;The 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire consisted of an elaborate set of festivities that took place on 12-16 October 1971 to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the Imperial State of Iran and the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great. The intent of the celebration was to demonstrate Iran's ancient civilization and history and to showcase its contemporary advances under His Imperial Majesty Mohammad Reza Shah, the last Shah of Iran. Some later historians came to think that this excess contributed to events that resulted in the Iranian Revolution and eventual replacement of the Persian monarchy with an Islamic republic under the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, who was supported by a wide range of people, including various leftist and Islamist organizations, and student movements. The event has been described as the most expensive party ever held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011433;In late October 1979, the exiled and dying Shah was admitted into the United States for cancer treatment. In Iran there was an immediate outcry, and both Khomeini and leftist groups demanded the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November 1979 youthful Islamists, calling themselves Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, invaded the US embassy compound in Tehran and seized its staff. Revolutionaries were angry because of how the Shah had fled abroad while the Embassy-based American CIA and British intelligence organized a coup d'etat to overthrow his nationalist opponent who was a legitimately elected official. The students held 52 American diplomats hostage for 444 days, which played a role in helping to pass the constitution, suppressing moderates, and otherwise radicalising the revolution. Holding the hostages was very popular and continued even after the death of the Shah. The hostage crisis ended with the signing of the Algiers Accords in Algeria on 19 January 1981. The hostages were formally released to United States custody the following day, just minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn in as the new American president.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011435;The Nojeh coup d'etat was a plan to overthrow the newly established Islamic Republic of Iran and its government of Abolhassan Banisadr and Ruhollah Khomeini. The plan involved officers and servicemen from the infantry, air force, army and secret service, and was largely halted by the arrest of hundreds of officers on 9-10 July 1980 at Nojeh Air Base, near Hamedan, although substantial sabotage damage had already been carried out, with only 28 tanks (of 159) operational in the frontline Khuzestan Province. The plan was organised by Colonel Muhammad Baqir Bani-Amiri, a retired Gendermerie officer, with the Shah's last Prime Minister, Shapour Bakhtiar, contributing financial support and providing his contacts and authority. Bakhtiar's liaison with the conspirators in Iran was the businessman Manucher Ghorbanifar, who headed the logistics branch of the Niqab network which organised the civilian part of the plot. According to then-President Abolhassan Banisadr, the government discovered eight major cells, and exposed the plotters' plan, leading to the arrests. Khomeini ordered those arrested for involvement in the coup to be executed, but Banisadr used legal ruses to delay the executions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011436;The Majlis (Iran's Parliament) impeached Banisadr in his absence on 21 June 1981, allegedly because of his moves against the clerics in power, in particular Mohammad Beheshti, then head of the judicial system. Khomeini himself appears to have instigated the impeachment, which he signed the next day. According to Katzman, Banisadr believed the clerics should not directly govern Iran and was perceived as supporting the People's Mujahedin of Iran. Even before Khomeini had signed the impeachment papers, the Revolutionary Guard had seized the Presidential buildings and gardens, and imprisoned writers at a newspaper closely tied to Banisadr. Over the next few days, they executed several of his closest friends, including Hossein Navab, Rashid Sadrolhefazi and Manouchehr Massoudi. Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri was among the few people in the government in support of Banisadr, but he was soon stripped of his powers. At the same time, the Iranian government outlawed all political parties, except the Islamic Republican Party. Government forces arrested and imprisoned members of other parties, such as the People's Mujahedin, Fadaian Khalq, Tudeh, and Paikar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011437;Khomeini's health declined several years prior to his death. After spending eleven days in Jamaran hospital, Ruhollah Khomeini died on 3 June 1989 after suffering five heart attacks in just ten days, at the age of 89 just before midnight. Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, a former student of Khomeini and a major figure of the Revolution, was chosen by Khomeini to be his successor as Supreme Leader and approved as such by the Assembly of Experts in November 1985. The execution of Mehdi Hashemi in September 1987 on charges of counterrevolutionary activities was a blow to Ayatollah Montazeri, who knew Hashemi since their childhood. In 1989 Montazeri began to call for liberalization, freedom for political parties. Following the execution of thousands of political prisoners by the Islamic government, Montazeri told Khomeini: "Your prisons are far worse than those of the Shah and his SAVAK." After a letter of his complaints was leaked to Europe and broadcast on the BBC, a furious Khomeini ousted him in March 1989 from his position as official successor. This allowed Ali Khamenei to become the next Supreme Leader;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201912;Absolute monarchy (or absolutism as doctrine) is a form of monarchy in which the monarch holds supreme autocratic authority, principally not being restricted by written laws, legislature, or customs. These are often hereditary monarchies. In contrast, in constitutional monarchies, the head of state's authority derives from or is legally bound or restricted by a constitution or legislature. The popularity of the notion of the absolute monarchy declined substantially after the French Revolution, which promoted theories of government based on popular sovereignty. Some monarchies have a weak or symbolic legislature and other governmental bodies which the monarch can alter or dissolve at will. As the King has absolute powers, his characteristics will be important in the governance of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201910;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ King has passed away today. This has come as a shock to many in $COUNTRY$ who have grown accustomed to his presence in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politics. As the monarchy is a hereditary one, the Crown will pass to the King's heir. He will be crowned King shortly after the royal funeral and then we will find out what sort of person our new monarch shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201911;An elective monarchy is a monarchy ruled by an elected monarch, in contrast to a hereditary monarchy in which the office is automatically passed down as a family inheritance. The manner of election, the nature of candidate qualifications, and the electors vary from case to case. Historically it is not uncommon for elective monarchies to transform into hereditary ones over time, or for hereditary ones to acquire at least occasional elective aspects. At the start of the 20th century, the first monarchs of several newly independent nations were elected by parliaments: Norway is the prime example. Previously, following precedent set in newly independent Greece, new nations without a well-established hereditary royal family often chose their own monarchs from among the established royal families of Europe, rather than elevate a member of the local power establishment, in the hope that a stable hereditary monarchy would eventually emerge from the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC22602;Population ageing is an increasing median age in a population due to declining fertility rates and rising life expectancy. Most countries have rising life expectancy and an ageing population (trends that emerged first in developed countries, but which are now seen in virtually all developing countries). This is the case for every country in the world except the 18 countries designated as "demographic outliers" by the UN. The aged population is currently at its highest level in human history. The UN predicts the rate of population ageing in the twenty-first century will exceed that of the previous century. The number of people aged 60 years and over has tripled since 1950, reaching 600 million in 2000 and surpassing 700 million in 2006. It is projected that the combined senior and geriatric population will reach 2.1 billion by 2050.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC80158691;Despite attempts by the President to interfere with the impeachment process and bully his party's senators to vote against impeachment, enough senators ultimately decided to vote in favour of impeachment to allow for the sitting President to be removed. This was however not received well by the now ex-President and his supporters who now agitate for succession from the United States to preserve their way of life. The new President will have to prepare for the possibility of a new civil war in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015874;Early in the morning on November 4, with vote counts still going on in many states, President Trump claimed that he had won. Although the final results were eventuallly called for Biden, Trump refused to acknowledge that Biden had won. At the same time, Trump blocked the General Services Administration from carrying out a transfer of power. The White House also ordered government agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team in any way and began a rapid agenda to salt the earth and lock in their policies before Joe Biden can take over. In addition, the Trump campaign filed a number of lawsuits in multiple states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. These lawsuits however ultimately failed to produce any results. Amidst all of this, there is rising anger against the Democrats by Republicans with some even calling for succession to 'stop the steal'. The day of the handover has finally arrived and the President-elect has to choose whether to cave in to Trump or to resist him, with the possibility of a civil war breaking out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015875;The Republicans are apparently more willing to break up the Union than expected. State legislatures controlled by them have passed resolutions to create an autonomous, separate Union government that they claim will respect their interests in a way that a Democrat government never will. Under the Constitution, secession is prohibited so unless we are ready to dishonour the founding fathers' wishes, we will have to fight them to reunite the nation. Our intelligence chiefs estimate that the Republican states will make a move against the federal government in about a months time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015876;There used to be a time when the Statue of Liberty stood as a symbol of a united America however this is no longer the case. Today, the statue is viewed through the lens of partisanship where "Liberty" for one group is no longer mutually compatible with that of another. This schism eventually proved irreconcilable and the disunited Union could no longer sustain itself. This culminated in several states issuing a declaration of independence to free themselves of a federal government they do not respect and cannot accept. These states want to be free again, free to be themselves, warts and all but only time will tell whether their aspirations of a government for their people by their people can last the annals of time and the scrutiny of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC801586331;On April 20, 2010, an offshore oil drilling rig, the Deepwater Horizon, exploded and burned off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. Dozens of workers fled the flames and were rescued by lifeboats and helicopters, however 11 were killed and 17 were injured in the incident. The rig burned for 36 hours before sinking. On April 24, it was discovered that a damaged wellhead was leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico at a rapid rate. For approximately 90 days, tens of thousands of barrels of oil leaked into the ocean every day, resulting in the largest oil spill in United States history. The wellhead was successfully contained in mid-July, stopping the flow, and efforts are ongoing to cap the wellhead and create a replacement well. Despite significant efforts to protect coastlines, the spill has had devastating impacts on the environment and the economies of the Gulf Coast states. The Obama administration has ordered well operator BP responsible for all cleanup costs, which are expected to run in the tens of billions of dollars. The spill has resulted in negative public approval ratings of the U.S. government, the Obama administration, and BP, for their handling of the spill, with BP suffering the worst ratings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8015873;The George Floyd protests were a series of police brutality protests that began in Minneapolis in the United States on May 26, 2020. Civil unrest and protests began as part of international responses to the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who was killed during an arrest after Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis Police Department officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as three other officers looked on and prevented passers-by from intervening. Local protests began in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota before quickly spreading nationwide and to over 2,000 cities and towns in over 60 countries in support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Polls in summer 2020 estimated that between 15 million and 26 million people had participated at some point in the demonstrations in the United States, making the protests the largest in U.S. history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015870;On 3 January 2020, a United States drone strike near Baghdad International Airport targeted and killed Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani while he was on his way to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi in Baghdad. Soleimani was commander of the Quds Force, one of five branches of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The strike occurred during the 2019-20 Persian Gulf crisis, which began after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, reimposed sanctions, and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. U.S. officials justified the Soleimani strike claiming it was necessary to stop an "imminent attack", though later clarifying the legal justification of the action as being taken "in response to an escalating series of attacks...to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks...and to end Iran's strategic escalation of attacks".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015872;Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 (PS752) was a scheduled international passenger flight from Tehran to Kyiv. On 8 January 2020, the Boeing 737-800 operating the route was shot down shortly after takeoff from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC). All 176 passengers and crew died. The Iranian government initially denied responsibility for the airplane's destruction, but investigation by Western intelligence agencies and the general public revealed that the aircraft was shot down by a surface-to-air missile launched by Iran. The Iranian government kept denying for at least three days, before finally admitting that the military had indeed shot down the civilian airliner. The revelation prompted mass protests calling for the removal of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, which broke out in Iran on 13 January in response to the shootdown and government denial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015866;The U.S. Congress had mandated increased military aid to Ukraine over the period of Trump's presidency. Congress appropriated $400 million in military aid to Ukraine for fiscal year 2019, to be used to spend on weapons and other equipment as well as programs to assist the Ukrainian military in combating threats from Putin's Russia and Russian-backed separatists of the self-proclaimed separatist entities in eastern Ukraine. In the July 25 call with Trump, Zelensky thanked Trump for the U.S.'s "great support in the area of defense", an apparent reference to military aid, and expressed an interest in acquiring more missiles. Trump replied, "I would like you to do us a favor though," suggesting an investigation into CrowdStrike, an American cybersecurity firm that investigated the cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee in 2015 and 2016. CrowdStrike was one of three firms whose analysis assisted the U.S. intelligence community in determining that Russian intelligence was responsible for the DNC hack. Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015867;The Trump-Ukraine scandal was a political scandal in the United States involving efforts by U.S. president Donald Trump to coerce Ukraine and other foreign countries into providing damaging narratives about then-2020 Democratic Party presidential candidate Joe Biden as well as misinformation relating to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Trump enlisted surrogates within and outside his official administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, to pressure Ukraine and other foreign governments to cooperate in supporting conspiracy theories concerning American politics. The scandal reached public attention in mid-September 2019 due to a whistleblower complaint made in August 2019. The complaint raised concerns about Trump using presidential powers to solicit foreign electoral intervention in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015868;In response to the whistleblower's report, on November 25, 2019, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff published a letter stating that next steps towards impeachment will be taken when a committee report regarding the impeachment inquiry will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee when Congress returns from its Thanksgiving recess. The Republicans of the House Committees had released a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence does not support accusations. This report concluded the inquiry stage of the impeachment process and the house then voted on the approved articles of impeachment. Trump was impeached on December 18, 2019. The impeachment trial of Donald Trump, the 45th and incumbent president of the United States, began in the U.S. Senate on January 16, 2020.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015869;Closing arguments were given by the prosecution and defense teams on February 3. That day, Democratic senator Joe Manchin, who was undecided on the trial vote, proposed the Senate censure the president to prevent his behavior to go "unchecked by the Senate", though there appeared to be little support for it. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) gave a speech reiterating the question which Chief Justice Roberts declined to read. On February 5, the Senate voted on whether or not to convict the president on the charges and evidence as they were presented and debated upon. The senators voted 52 to 48 to find Trump not guilty on the charge of abuse of power. All 45 Democrats, Independent senators Bernie Sanders and Angus King, and Republican senator Mitt Romney voted guilty. On the second charge, the Senate voted 53 to 47, in a party-line vote, to find him not guilty on the charge of obstruction of Congress. On February 6, the day after the trial ended, Trump gave a speech to a large group of supporters to "discuss our country's victory on the impeachment hoax". He held up a copy of The Washington Post with the headline "Trump Acquitted", saying "It's the only good headline I've ever had in The Washington Post.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610134;An economic forum was held in $CAPITAL$ where all the regional economic administrators were invited to discuss the next direction that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ economy should take for the next five years. A coalition of heavy industry managers have urged the $MONARCHTITLE$ to favour heavy industry investment while the union of consumer goods industry bosses have encouraged the expansion of their industry instead. The service industry lobby have also put forward interesting proposals to further grow their sector. The last group to submit their proposals were the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals who have called for more military R&D funding and resources to boost weapons production. These generals stressed that the nation's first priority should always be the military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015847;A new consciousness of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women (NOW) to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans. Protests began, and the new women's liberation movement grew in size and power, gained much media attention, and, by 1968, had replaced the Civil Rights Movement as the U.S's main social revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015848;Amid the Cold War, the United States entered the Vietnam War, whose growing unpopularity fed already existing social movements, including those among women, minorities, and young people. President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society social programs and numerous rulings by the Warren Court added to the wide range of social reform during the 1960s and 1970s. Feminism and the environmental movement became political forces, and progress continued toward civil rights for all Americans. The Counterculture Revolution swept through the nation and much of the western world in the late sixties and early seventies, further dividing Americans in a "culture war" but also bringing forth more liberated social views.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80158631;The Patriot Act was enacted in direct response to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, as well as the 2001 anthrax attacks, to dramatically strengthen national security. Opponents of the law have criticised its provision for indefinite detention of immigrants, permission to law enforcement to search a home or business without the owner's or the occupant's consent or knowledge under certain circumstances, the expanded use of National Security Letters, which allows the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to search telephone, e-mail, and financial records without a court order;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80158632;The United States housing bubble was a real estate bubble affecting over half of the U.S. states. It was the impetus for the subprime mortgage crisis. Housing prices peaked in early 2006, started to decline in 2006 and 2007, and reached new lows in 2012. On December 30, 2008, the Case-Shiller home price index reported its largest price drop in its history. The credit crisis resulting from the bursting of the housing bubble is an important cause of the Great Recession in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80158633;In September 2008, the United States and most of Europe entered the longest post-World War II recession, often called the "Great Recession". Multiple overlapping crises were involved, especially the housing market crisis, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, an automotive industry crisis, rising unemployment, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Following his election victory by a wide electoral margin in November 2008, Bush's successor - Barack Obama - signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was a $787 billion economic stimulus aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening recession. From 2009 to 2010, the 111th Congress passed major legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, informally known as Obamacare, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which were signed into law by President Obama.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

instigate_rebels_superpower_desc;Our rival superpower currently has a large sphere of influence across the world. This can pose a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. As such, our generals have propsed that we sponsor clandestine activities to bolster the opposition in countries that comprise our rival's sphere. Authorising such an operation will allow us to reduce the ideology support of our rival and increase militancy and consciousness in those countries that may help trigger a revolution in our favour. Such activities are however viewed as illegal by the United Nations and can lead to sanctions if our infamy is high enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8015855;The people of the United States were betrayed by the Republican's blind loyalty to President Nixon in acquitting him of his grave abuses of power. This came as a shock to many Americans who thought that their elected leaders would have protected them from such an outcome. However what is done is done and the nation's democracy has taken a hit. Only time will tell whether the United States can survive this watershed blow to its democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610133;$COUNTRY$ has been struck by nuclear weapons and as a result, much of the nation's infrastructure has been destroyed. In addition, many non-essential government officials were also terminated by the blasts as they were not deemed important enough to have a place in the government's limited shelters. It is therefore apparent that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government can no longer operate as it did before the war as it must now rely on a skeleton crew of officials to run the entire nation's affairs. Although the taxation department was well protected by the blasts so we can resume tax collection activities post war to gather resources to rebuild the nation, the nation's domestic police and parliamentary staff were less fortunate. As such, our top generals have advised the $MONARCHTITLE$ to suspend all civil liberties, including the right to vote, and grant dictatorial powers to all surviving regional administrators to enable an orderly transition to a new, rebuilt $COUNTRY$. They stress that it is a necessary evil under the current circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC801262212;These ethnic second-tier governments in Namibia were de facto suspended in May 1989, at the start of the transition to independence, and de iure abolished on 21 March 1990 (the day Namibia became independent) in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Constitution of Namibia. The Basters lobbied unsuccessfully to maintain the autonomous status of Rehoboth, which had previously been autonomous under German rule. In the former Bantustan of East Caprivi, Lozi nationalists launched an unsuccessful insurgency in an attempt to gain independence from Namibia which lasted until 1999.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2020102;$FROMCOUNTRY$, a Security Council Permanent Member, has vetoed a resolution to end an ongoing conflict in the world.

EVTDESC1412169;When the nuclear fallout shelters were first built, no one dared imagine that it would someday be used. Unfortunately, the day has arrived. It began as any other day with the nation's citizens turning on the news to get updated on the current state of the war over breakfast. However the people were blissfully unaware of an incoming threat that would end their world as they knew it. Shortly past 9 am, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Airforce Command began to detect a flurry nuclear missiles headed for $COUNTRY$. This triggered a nation wide alarm to seek shelter which quite a few thought was merely a false alarm. For those who did take it seriously, there was a stampede to reach the bunker as men, women and children pushed each other aside to enter the bunker through its narrow door. Before long, the bombs inevitably started to hit $COUNTRY_ADJ$ cities and those who were left outside were immediately vapourised. For the lucky few who managed to seek refuge, this is only the beginning of a nightmare that would not end anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC14121691;Due to either poor foresight or criminal laziness, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government failed to provide adequate Civil Defence protection to the people before the nuclear strike began. As millions of innocent citizens were being vapourised by the nuclear blasts all over the country, so too were the nation's communication infrastructure. As a result of this tragic mistake, the government is no longer able to exercise control over the entire nation. Some say that the $COUNTRY$ might break up because of this. This is likely to be correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC14121692;There have been reports of rural provinces in $COUNTRY$ being overrun by anarchist mobs. The residual $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military forces were unable to suppress them causing a total loss of control over those provinces. This is a further blow to our nation's ability to recover from the nuclear strike. It seems that running a nuclear wasteland from a bunker in a state capital is not as easy as what the pre-war government thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610132;Until today, there have been rumblings amongst the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ leadership of a loss of confidence in the $MONARCHTITLE$'s ability to protect $COUNTRY$ in this defensive war. These angry politicians and military generals feel that the pacifist slant of the cabinent would make it too easy for the country to give up its interests and would likely lead to an unfavourable peace deal with the enemy. This unrest has boiled over into a coup against the government by the hardliners who are calling for a more jingoist stance against the enemy. What will happen to $COUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC82030031;The South Tyrolean question became an international issue. As the implementation of the post-war agreement was not seen as satisfactory by the Austrian government, it became a cause of significant friction with Italy and was taken up by the United Nations in 1960. A fresh round of negotiations took place in 1961 but proved unsuccessful, partly because of the campaign of terrorism. The issue was resolved in 1971, when a new Austro-Italian treaty was signed and ratified. It stipulated that disputes in South Tyrol would be submitted for settlement to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, that the province would receive greater autonomy within Italy, and that Austria would not interfere in South Tyrol's internal affairs. The new autonomous status, granted from 1972 onwards, has resulted in a considerable level of self-government, also due to the large financial resources of South Tyrol, retaining almost 90% of all levied taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8018016;The Land to the Tiller project carried out in Vietnam from 1970 to 1973 was based on a proposal by Roy Prosterman, a prominent American "land-rights-activist", who the US government of the time recruited within its efforts against Viet Cong in South Vietnam. Drawing on experiences in other countries (particularly in Latin America), Prosterman proposed a "land-to-the-tiller" program to compete with the Viet Cong for the allegiance of the peasants. The plan mimicked the communists' land expropriation strategy, coupled with monetary compensation to the former landowners. On 26 March 1970, with the war still underway, the government of South Vietnam began implementation of the Land-to-the-Tiller program following Prosterman's model. In total, the United States financed 339 million US dollars of the reform's 441 million dollars of expenses. Individual holdings were limited to 15 hectares. Legal titles were extended to peasants in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom land had previously been distributed by the Viet Cong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC12280031;The Gulf of Tonkin incident was a disputed international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in the Vietnam War. It involved both a real confrontation and a fabricated confrontation between ships of North Vietnam and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents. On Sunday, August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox, while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was falsely claimed to have been approached by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron. Maddox fired three warning shots, and it was claimed the North Vietnamese boats attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire. Maddox expended over 280 3-inch (76 mm) and 5-inch (130 mm) shells in a sea battle. According to the false report: One U.S. aircraft was damaged, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats were damaged, and four North Vietnamese sailors were killed, with six more wounded. There were no U.S. casualties. Maddox was "unscathed except for a single bullet hole from a Vietnamese machine gun round". The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by US Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted US President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by "communist aggression".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1228006;The Ho Chi Minh trail was a logistical network of roads and trails that ran from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) to the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) through the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia. The system provided support, in the form of manpower and materiel, to the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (called the Viet Cong or "VC") and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), or North Vietnamese Army, during the Vietnam War. The trail ran mostly in Laos, and was called by the communists the Tr??ng S?n Strategic Supply Route, after the Vietnamese name for the Annamite Range mountains in central Vietnam, and the communists further identified the trail as either West Tr??ng S?n (Laos) or East Tr??ng S?n (Vietnam). According to the United States National Security Agency's official history of the war, the trail system was "one of the great achievements of military engineering of the 20th century". The trail was able to effectively supply troops fighting in the south, a military feat unparalleled given it was the site of the single most intense bombing campaign in history, with bombs dropping on average every seven minutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80072331;After protracted negotiations, both India and Pakistan agreed to a cease-fire. The terms of the cease-fire, laid out in a UN Commission resolution on 13 August 1948, were adopted by the Commission on 5 January 1949. This required Pakistan to withdraw its forces, both regular and irregular, while allowing India to maintain minimal forces within the state to preserve law and order. Upon compliance with these conditions, a plebiscite was to be held to determine the future of the territory. Indian losses in the war totaled 1,104 killed and 3,154 wounded while Pakistan suffered about 6,000 killed and 14,000 wounded. India gained control of about two-thirds of Kashmir while Pakistan gained the remaining one-third. Most neutral assessments agree that India emerged victorious from the war, as it successfully defended most of the contested territory, including the Kashmir valley, Jammu, and Ladakh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007235;With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor. Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire. Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India bowed to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire. On 22 September, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations. The war ended the following day. The United States and the Soviet Union used significant diplomatic tools to prevent any further escalation in the conflict between the two South Asian nations. The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexei Kosygin, hosted ceasefire negotiations in Tashkent (now in Uzbekistan), where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, agreeing to withdraw to pre-August lines no later than 25 February 1966.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1228003;The Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. In 1957, independent observers from India, Poland, and Canada representing the International Control Commission (ICC) stated that fair, unbiased elections were not possible, reporting that neither South nor North Vietnam had honored the armistice agreement: "The elections were not held. South Vietnam, which had not signed the Geneva Accords, did not believe the Communists in North Vietnam would allow a fair election. In January 1957, the ICC agreed with this perception, reporting that neither South nor North Vietnam had honored the armistice agreement. With the French gone, a return to the traditional power struggle between north and south had begun again.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1228004;Following the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Hanoi anticipated the arrival of US troops and began expanding the Viet Cong, as well as sending increasing numbers of North Vietnamese personnel southwards. At this phase they were outfitting the Viet Cong forces and standardising their equipment with AK-47 rifles and other supplies, as well as forming the 9th Division.[33]:223[130] "From a strength of approximately 5,000 at the start of 1959 the Viet Cong's ranks grew to about 100,000 at the end of 1964 ... Between 1961 and 1964 the Army's strength rose from about 850,000 to nearly a million men.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1228005;The Vietnam War was a conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. The conflict emerged from the First Indochina War against the communist-led Viet Minh. Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. After the French quit Indochina in 1954, the US assumed financial and military support for the South Vietnamese state. The Viet Cong initiated a guerrilla war in the south. North Vietnam had also invaded Laos in the mid-1950s in support of insurgents, establishing the Ho Chi Minh Trail to supply and reinforce the Viet Cong. U.S. involvement escalated under President John F. Kennedy through the MAAG program from just under a thousand military advisors in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. By 1963, the North Vietnamese had sent 40,000 soldiers to fight in South Vietnam. North Vietnam was heavily backed by the USSR and the People's Republic of China. On 8 March 1965, 3,500 U.S. Marines were landed near Da Nang, South Vietnam. This marked the beginning of the American ground war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80180131;In Hue, the Buddhist majority was prohibited from displaying Buddhist flags during Vesak celebrations commemorating the birth of Gautama Buddha when the government cited a regulation prohibiting the display of non-government flags. However, the ban on religious flags led to a protest led by Thich Tri Quang against the government, which was suppressed by Di?m's forces, and unarmed civilians were killed in the clash. Di?m and his supporters blamed the Vi?t C?ng for the deaths and claimed the protesters were responsible for the violence. Although the provincial chief expressed sorrow for the killings and offered to compensate the victims' families, they resolutely denied that government forces were responsible for the killings and blamed the Viet Cong. The Buddhists pushed for a five-point agreement: freedom to fly religious flags, an end to arbitrary arrests, compensation for the Hu? victims, punishment for the officials responsible, and religious equality. The turning point came in June when a Buddhist monk, Thich Qu?ng ??c, set himself on fire in the middle of a busy Saigon intersection in protest of Di?m's policies. Photos of this event were disseminated around the world, and for many people these pictures came to represent the failure of Di?m's government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8018015;Di?m's removal and assassination set off a period of political instability and declining legitimacy of the Saigon government. General D??ng V?n Minh became president, but he was ousted in January 1964 by General Nguy?n Khanh. Phan Kh?c S?u was named head of state, but power remained with a junta of generals led by Khanh, which soon fell to infighting. Khanh sought to capitalize on the crisis with the V?ng Tau Charter, a new constitution that would have curtailed civil liberties and concentrated his power, but was forced to back down in the face of widespread protests and strikes. Coup attempts followed in September and February 1965, the latter resulting in Air Marshal Nguy?n Cao K? becoming prime minister and General Nguy?n V?n Thi?u becoming nominal head of state. K? and Thieu functioned in those roles until 1967, bringing much-desired stability to the government. They imposed censorship and suspended civil liberties, and intensified anticommunist efforts. Under pressure from the US, they held elections for president and the legislature in 1967. The Senate election took place on 2 September 1967. The Presidential election took place on 3 September 1967, Thi?u was elected president with 34% of the vote in a widely criticised poll.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8008411;The Laotian Civil War (1959-1975) was a civil war in Laos fought between the Communist Pathet Lao (including many North Vietnamese of Lao ancestry) and the Royal Lao Government from 23 May 1959 to 2 December 1975. It is associated with the Cambodian Civil War and the Vietnam War, with both sides receiving heavy external support in a proxy war between the global Cold War superpowers. It is called the Secret War among the CIA Special Activities Center and Hmong veterans of the conflict. The actual fighting in Laos involved the North Vietnamese Army, U.S. troops and Thai forces and South Vietnamese army forces directly and through irregular proxies in a struggle for control over the Laotian Panhandle. The North Vietnamese Army occupied the area to use for its Ho Chi Minh Trail supply corridor and as staging area for offensives into South Vietnam. There was a second major theater of action on and near the northern Plain of Jars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8008413;On 7 January 1960, a 67-year-old moderate politician named Kou Abhay was appointed as Prime Minister of Laos. His mandate was to serve until elections in April. Kong Le's ascension to power had lifted him from obscurity to the world's notice. Both sides of the proxy war, the Americans and the Russians, began to shape their moves to influence him. Within a day, the Pathet Lao pledged their cooperation with Kong Le. Once in power, Kong Le denounced foreign intervention in Laos. In a series of public speeches on 10 and 11 August, the new head of state spoke out for the need for national neutrality. He saw little reason for Lao to fight Lao, as the Pathet Lao and the Royalists were doing. He resented undue influence by the wealthy ruling families.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8008414;On 10 August 1960, Kong Le would oust Phoumi in his own coup. In return, Phoumi would return to power with the aid of the Central Intelligence Agency (including John Hasey) on 16 December in the Battle of Vientiane during his counter-coup. He was aided in this by Generals Kouprasith Abhay and Siho Lamphouthacoul. Phoumi reclaimed the Ministry of Defense after his counter-coup reclaimed the country, as well as becoming the Deputy Prime Minister on 4 January 1961. From 1961 to 1963, he carried out military operations contrary to his American advisers' wishes, figuring the U.S. would have to support him regardless. His American backers periodically curtailed military aid to his forces to compel his compliance, even as the Royal Lao Army's performance deteriorated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017042;The constituent assembly adopted the constitution of Bangladesh on 4 November 1972, establishing a secular, multiparty parliamentary democracy. The new constitution included references to socialism, and Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman nationalised major industries in 1972. A major reconstruction and rehabilitation program was launched. The Awami League won the country's first general election in 1973, securing a large majority in the "Jatiyo Sangshad", the national parliament. In January 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman introduced one-party socialist rule under BAKSAL. Rahman banned all newspapers except four state-owned publications, and amended the constitution to increase his power. Amid growing agitation by the opposition National Awami Party and Jashod, he became increasingly authoritarian. Rahman amended the constitution, giving himself more emergency powers (including the suspension of fundamental rights).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017043;In January 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman introduced one-party socialist rule under BAKSAL. Rahman banned all newspapers except four state-owned publications, and amended the constitution to increase his power. He was assassinated during a coup on 15 August 1975. Martial law was declared, and the presidency passed to the usurper Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad for four months. Ahmad is widely regarded as a traitor by Bangladeshis. Tajuddin Ahmad, the nation's first prime minister, and four other independence leaders were assassinated on 4 November 1975. Chief Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem was installed as president by the military on 6 November 1975. Bangladesh was governed by a military junta led by the Chief Martial Law Administrator for three years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017044;In 1977, the army chief Ziaur Rahman became president.

EVTDESC8017045;A semi-presidential system evolved, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) governing until 1982. Rahman was assassinated in 1981, and was succeeded by Vice-President Abdus Sattar. Sattar received 65.5 percent of the vote in the 1981 presidential election. After a year in office, Sattar was overthrown in the 1982 Bangladesh coup d'etat. Chief Justice A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury was installed as president, but army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad became the country's de facto leader and assumed the presidency in 1983.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80072271;The Congress party chose Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's older son, as the next Prime Minister. Rajiv had been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40, was the youngest national political leader and Prime Minister ever. But his youth and inexperience were an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and looking for newer policies and a fresh start to resolve the country's long-standing problems. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress party to its largest majority in history (over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother's assassination. Rajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the Licence Raj was loosened, and government restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use resources and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment increased India's national reserves. As Prime Minister, Rajiv broke from his mother's precedent to improve relations with the United States, which increased economic aid and scientific co-operation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80072272;The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi occurred as a result of a suicide bombing in Sriperumbudur, Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, India on 21 May 1991. At least 14 others, in addition to Rajiv Gandhi, were killed. It was carried out by Thenmozhi Rajaratnam (also known as Kalaivani Rajaratnam or Dhanu), a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). At the time, India had just ended its involvement, through the Indian Peace Keeping Force, in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Subsequent accusations of conspiracy have been addressed by two commissions of inquiry and have brought down at least one national government. The Supreme Court held that the decision to eliminate Gandhi was precipitated by his interview to Sunday magazine (21-28 August 1990), where he stated that he would send the IPKF to disarm the LTTE if he returned to power. Gandhi also defended the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord in the same interview. The LTTE decision to kill him was perhaps aimed at preventing him from coming to power again. Thereafter, the Justice J S Verma Commission was formed to look into the security lapses that contributed to the killing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80110081;General elections were held in Pakistan on 7 December 1970 to elect members of the National Assembly. They were the first general elections since the independence of Pakistan and ultimately the only ones held prior to the independence of Bangladesh. Voting took place in 300 constituencies, of which 162 were in East Pakistan and 138 in West Pakistan. The result was a victory for the Awami League, which won an absolute majority of 160 seats, all of which were in East Pakistan. The PPP won only 81 seats, all in West Pakistan. In the provincial elections held ten days later, the Awami League again dominated in East Pakistan, while the PPP were the winning party in Punjab and Sindh. The Marxist National Awami Party emerged victorious in Northwest Frontier Province and Balochistan. The National Assembly was initially not inaugurated as President Yahya Khan and the PPP chairman Zulfikar Ali Bhutto did not want a party from East Pakistan in federal government. Instead, Yahya appointed the veteran Bengali politician Nurul Amin as Prime Minister, asking him to reach a compromise between the PPP and Awami League. However, this move failed as the delay in inauguration had already caused significant unrest in East Pakistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011013;The assassination of Benazir Bhutto took place on 27 December 2007 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto, twice Prime Minister of Pakistan and then-leader of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party, had been campaigning ahead of elections scheduled for January 2008. Shots were fired at her after a political rally at Liaqat National Bagh, and a suicide bomb was detonated immediately following the shooting. She was declared dead at 18:16 local time (13:16 UTC), at Rawalpindi General Hospital. Twenty-three other people were killed by the bombing. Bhutto had previously survived a similar attempt on her life (the 2007 Karsaz bombing) that killed at least 180 people, after her return from exile two months earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007023;The First Cod War lasted from 1 September 1958 to 11 March 1961. It began as soon as a new Icelandic law came into force and expanded the Icelandic fishery zone from 4 to 12 nautical miles (7.4 to 22.2 km) at midnight on 1 September 1958. All members of NATO opposed the unilateral Icelandic extension. The British declared that their trawlers would fish under protection from their warships in three areas: out of the Westfjords, north of Horn and southeast of Iceland. In all, twenty British trawlers, four warships and a supply vessel were inside the newly declared zones. The deployment of the Royal Navy to contested waters led to protests in Iceland. Demonstrations against the British embassy were met with taunts by the British ambassador, Andrew Gilchrist, as he played bagpipe music and military marches on his gramophone. Many incidents followed. The Icelanders were, however, at a disadvantage in patrolling the contested waters because of the size of the area and the limited number of patrol ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007029;At the third United Nations Conference of the Law on the Sea in 1973, several countries supported a 100 nmi (185 km) limit to territorial waters. On 15 July 1975, the Icelandic government announced its intention to extend its fishery limits. The Third Cod War (November 1975 - June 1976) began after Iceland again extended its fishing limits, now to 200 nmi (370 km) from its coast. The British government did not recognise the large increase to the exclusion zone and so an issue occurred with British fishermen and their activity in the disputed zone. The conflict, which was the most hard-fought of the Cod Wars, saw British fishing trawlers have their nets cut by the Icelandic Coast Guard, and there were several incidents of ramming by Icelandic ships and British trawlers, frigates and tugboats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017040;The Bangladesh Liberation War was a revolution and armed conflict sparked by the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement in what was then East Pakistan during the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. It resulted in the independence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The war began after the Pakistani military junta based in West Pakistan launched Operation Searchlight against the people of East Pakistan on the night of 25 March 1971. It pursued the systematic elimination of nationalist Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia, religious minorities and armed personnel. The junta annulled the results of the 1970 elections and arrested Prime minister-designate Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The war ended on 16 December 1971 after West Pakistan surrendered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8017041;The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was a military confrontation between India and Pakistan that occurred during the liberation war in East Pakistan from 3 December 1971 to the fall of Dacca (Dhaka) on 16 December 1971. The war began with preemptive aerial strikes on 11 Indian air stations, which led to the commencement of hostilities with Pakistan and Indian entry into the war of independence in East Pakistan on the side of Bengali nationalist forces. Lasting just 13 days, it is one of the shortest wars in history. During the war, Indian and Pakistani militaries simultaneously clashed on the eastern and western fronts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8229000;The Sino-Indian War was a war between China and India that occurred in 1962. A Chinese disputed Himalayan border was the main cause of the war. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. Chinese military action grew increasingly aggressive after India rejected proposed Chinese diplomatic settlements throughout 1960-1962, with China re-commencing previously-banned "forward patrols" in Ladakh from 30 April 1962. China finally abandoned all attempts of peaceful resolution on 20 October 1962, invading disputed territory along the 3,225 kilometre long Himalayan border in Ladakh and across the McMahon Line. Chinese troops advanced over Indian forces in both theatres, capturing Rezang La in Chushul in the western theatre, as well as Tawang in the eastern theatre. The war ended when China declared a ceasefire on 20 November 1962, and simultaneously announced its withdrawal to its claimed "Line of Actual Control".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011007;The Objectives Resolution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on March 12, 1949. Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, had presented it in the assembly on March 7, 1949. Out of 75 members of the assembly, 21 voted for it. All the amendments proposed by minority members were rejected. Consequently, all ten of them voted against it. The resolution proclaimed that the future constitution of Pakistan would not be modeled entirely on a European pattern, but on the ideology and democratic faith of Islam. The resolution, in its entirety, has been made part of the Constitution of Pakistan under Article 2(A).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011008;In 1956, the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan approved a constitution. However, the new constitution was followed by political turmoil in Pakistan, which saw a succession of four prime ministers. There was already a precedent in Governor General Malik Ghulam Muhammad dismissing prime ministers and ruling by decree, and many viewed Mirza as manipulating the constitution and instigating ousters of governments. The One Unit scheme amalgamating the provinces of Pakistan into two wings - West Pakistan and East Pakistan - was politically controversial and proving difficult to administer. The quick succession of prime ministers fostered the view within the military and in the public that Pakistani politicians were too weak and corrupt to govern effectively, and that the parliamentary system was flawed. On October 7, President Iskander Mirza declared martial law in Pakistan. On October 27, Iskander Mirza resigned from the presidency, transferring it to Ayub Khan. It is widely held that Ayub Khan and generals loyal to him forced Mirza to resign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011009;Bhutto founded the PPP in 1967 on a socialist platform, and contested general elections held by President Yahya Khan in 1970. While the Awami League won a majority of seats overall, the PPP won a majority of seats in West Pakistan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011010;Operation Fair Play was the code name for the 5 July 1977 coup by Pakistan Chief of Army Staff General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, overthrowing the government of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The coup itself was bloodless, and was preceded by social unrest and political conflict between the ruling leftist Pakistan Peoples Party government of Bhutto, and the right-wing Islamist opposition Pakistan National Alliance which accused Bhutto of rigging the 1977 general elections. In announcing the coup, Zia promised "free and fair elections" within 90 days, but these were repeatedly postponed on the excuse of accountability and it was not until 1985 that ("party-less") general elections were held. Zia himself stayed in power for eleven years until his death in a plane crash. The coup was a watershed event in the Cold War and in the history of the country. The coup took place nearly six years after the 1971 war with India which ended with the secession of East Pakistan as Bangladesh. The period following the coup saw the "Islamisation of Pakistan".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011011;President Zia died in a plane crash in 1988, and Benazir Bhutto, daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the country's first female Prime Minister.  Ideologically a liberal and a secularist, she chaired or co-chaired the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) from the early 1980s until her assassination in 2007.  She returned in 1986 and-influenced by Thatcherite economics-transformed the PPP's platform from a socialist to a liberal one, before leading it to victory in the 1988 election. As Prime Minister, her attempts at reform were stifled by conservative and Islamist forces, including President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the powerful military. Her administration was accused of corruption and nepotism and dismissed by Khan in 1990. Intelligence services rigged that year's election to ensure a victory for the conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance (IJI), at which Bhutto became Leader of the Opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1300014;The Licence Raj was the system of licences, regulations and accompanying red tape that were required to set up and run businesses in India between 1947 and 1990. Up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something and, if granted, the government would regulate production. The term plays off "British Raj", the period of British rule in India. A key characteristic of the Licence Raj was a Planning Commission that centrally administered the economy of the country. Like a command economy, India had Five-Year Plans on the lines of the Five-Year Plans in the Soviet Union. The Planning Commission was set up in 1950 to survey the available resources in the country and formulate plans to raise the standard of living. Another main characteristic of the License Raj was heavy regulation on industry. The Indian currency, the rupee, was inconvertible and high tariffs and import licensing prevented foreign goods reaching the market. The government also prevented firms from laying off workers or closing factories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007221;Prime Minister Nehru led the Congress to major election victories in 1957 and 1962. The Parliament passed extensive reforms that increased the legal rights of women in Hindu society, and further legislated against caste discrimination and untouchability. Nehru advocated a strong initiative to enroll India's children to complete primary education, and thousands of schools, colleges and institutions of advanced learning, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, were founded across the nation. Nehru advocated a socialist model for the economy of India - Five-Year Plans were shaped by the Soviet model based on centralised and integrated national economic programs.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007222;Nehru's health began declining steadily after 1962, and he spent months recuperating in Kashmir through 1963. Some historians attribute this dramatic decline to his surprise and chagrin over the Sino-Indian War, which he perceived as a betrayal of trust. Upon his return from Dehradun on 26 May 1964 he was feeling quite comfortable and went to bed at about 23:30 as usual, he had a restful night until about 06:30 soon after he returned from bathroom, Nehru complained of pain in the back. He spoke to the doctors who attended on him for a brief while and almost immediately Nehru collapsed. He remained unconscious until he died. His death was announced to Lok Sabha at 14:00 local time on 27 May 1964 (same day);;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007228;The Royal Indian Navy revolt encompasses a total strike and subsequent revolt by Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy on board ship and shore establishments at Bombay harbour on 18 February 1946. From the initial flashpoint in Bombay, the revolt spread and found support throughout British India, from Karachi to Calcutta, and ultimately came to involve over 20,000 sailors in 78 ships and shore establishments. The mutiny was suppressed by British troops and Royal Navy warships. Total casualties were 8 dead and 33 wounded. The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League condemned the mutiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007225;The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi. The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government began to unravel over the issue of the dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Hindu nationalist, paramilitary organisation. The ambitious Union finance minister, Charan Singh, who as the Union home minister during the previous year had ordered the Gandhi's' arrests, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979. Singh was appointed prime minister, by President Reddy, after Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi promised Singh that Congress would support his government from outside on certain conditions. The conditions included dropping all charges against Gandhi and Sanjay. Since Singh refused to drop them, Congress withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979. The Congress Party under Gandhi swept back into power in January 1980.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007227;The day before her death, Gandhi visited Odisha where she gave her last speech at the then Parade Ground in front of the Secretariat of Odisha. In that speech, which some consider as a premonition of her imminent death, she said that she would be proud to die serving the nation: "I am alive today, I may not be there tomorrow ... I shall continue to serve until my last breath and when I die, I can say, that every drop of my blood will invigorate India and strengthen it... Even if I died in the service of the nation, I would be proud of it. Every drop of my blood ... will contribute to the growth of this nation and to make it strong and dynamic." On 31 October 1984, two of Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, shot her with their service weapons in the garden of the prime minister's residence at 1 Safdarjung Road, New Delhi, allegedly in revenge for the Operation Bluestar. The shooting occurred as she was walking past a wicket gate guarded by the two men. Beant Singh shot her three times using his side-arm, Satwant Singh fired 30 rounds. The men dropped their weapons and surrendered. Afterwards, they were taken away by other guards into a closed room where Beant Singh was shot dead. Kehar Singh was later arrested for conspiracy in the attack. Both Satwant and Kehar were sentenced to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007272;The 1984 anti-Sikh riots, also known as the 1984 Sikh Massacre, was a series of organised pogroms against Sikhs in India following the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. The ruling Indian National Congress had been in active complicity with the mob, as to the organisation of the riots. Government estimates project that about 2,800 Sikhs were killed in Delhi and 3,350 nationwide, whilst independent sources estimate the number of deaths at about 8,000-17,000. In the aftermath of the pogroms, the government reported that 20,000 had fled the city;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007223;In India, "The Emergency" refers to a 21-month period from 1975 to 1977 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had a state of emergency declared across the country. Officially issued by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed under Article 352 of the Constitution because of the prevailing "internal disturbance", the Emergency was in effect from 25 June 1975 until its withdrawal on 21 March 1977. The order bestowed upon the Prime Minister the authority to rule by decree, allowing elections to be suspended and civil liberties to be curbed. For much of the Emergency, most of Indira Gandhi's political opponents were imprisoned and the press was censored. The final decision to impose an emergency was proposed by Indira Gandhi, agreed upon by the president of India, and thereafter ratified by the cabinet and the parliament (from July to August 1975), based on the rationale that there were imminent internal and external threats to the Indian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007224;In 1977, after extending the state of emergency twice, Gandhi called elections to give the electorate a chance to vindicate her rule. She may have grossly misjudged her popularity by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about her. She was opposed by the Janata alliance of Opposition parties. The alliance was made up of Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Congress (O), The Socialist parties, and Charan Singh's Bharatiya Kranti Dal representing northern peasants and farmers. The Janata alliance, with Jai Prakash Narayan as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between "democracy and dictatorship". The Congress Party also split during the election campaign of 1977. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007230;With the independence of the British Dominions, the British Paramountcy over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an Instrument of Accession. Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister Ram Chandra Kak, decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the State would not be comfortable with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable if the state joined Pakistan. The predominant political movement in the Kashmir Valley, the National Conference led by Sheikh Abdullah, believed in secular politics. It was allied with the Indian National Congress and was believed to favour joining India. On the other hand, the Muslims of the Jammu province supported the Muslim Conference, which was allied to the All-India Muslim League and favoured joining Pakistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007231;With the independence of the Dominions, the British Paramountcy over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an Instrument of Accession. Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister Ram Chandra Kak, decided not to accede to either dominion. According to Indian military sources, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called Operation Gulmarg and put it into action as early as 20 August, a few days after Pakistan's independence. According to the plan, 20 lashkars (tribal militias), each consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribesmen, were to be recruited from among various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at Bannu, Wanna, Peshawar, Kohat, Thall and Nowshera by the first week of September. They were expected to reach the launching point of Abbottabad on 18 October, and cross into Jammu and Kashmir on 22 October. This was to annex Kashmir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007232;Following the Muslim revolution in the Poonch and Mirpur area and Pakistani backed Pashtun tribal intervention from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa aimed at supporting the revolution, the Maharaja asked for Indian military assistance. Lord Mountbatten urged him to accede to India to complete the legal formalities, although Mountbatten's insistence on accession before assistance has been questioned. The Maharaja complied, and the Government of India recognised the accession of the princely state to India. Indian troops were sent to the state to defend it. The Jammu & Kashmir National Conference volunteers aided the Indian Army in its campaign to drive out the Pathan invaders. Pakistan refused to recognise the accession of Kashmir to India, claiming that it was obtained by "fraud and violence." Governor General Mohammad Ali Jinnah ordered its Army Chief General Douglas Gracey to move Pakistani troops to Kashmir at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007233;The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948 was fought between India and Pakistan over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. It was the first of four Indo-Pakistan Wars fought between the two newly independent nations. Pakistan precipitated the war a few weeks after independence by launching tribal lashkar (militia) from Waziristan, in an effort to capture Kashmir, the future of which hung in the balance. The Maharaja faced an uprising by his Muslim subjects in Poonch, and lost control of the western districts of his kingdom. On 22 October 1947, Pakistan's Pashtun tribal militias crossed the border of the state. These local tribal militias and irregular Pakistani forces moved to take Srinagar, but on reaching Baramulla, they took to plunder and stalled. Maharaja Hari Singh made a plea to India for assistance, and help was offered, but it was subject to his signing an Instrument of Accession to India.  Following the accession of the state to India on 26 October 1947, Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar, the state capital. The British commanding officers initially refused the entry of Pakistani troops into the conflict, citing the accession of the state to India. However, later in 1948, they relented and the Pakistani armies entered the war after this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007234;The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India. The conflict began following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared through UNSC Resolution 211 following a diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Much of the war was fought by the countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8930000;The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy. The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany in the years 1945-1948. Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years. The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era. Japan recovered much later. China returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8204101;In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist-Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. The founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognise. East Berlin included most of the city's historic centre. The West German government established itself in Bonn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8204400;The Stalin Note was a document delivered to the representatives of the Western allied powers from the Soviet Occupation in Germany on March 10, 1952. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin put forth a proposal for a reunification and neutralisation of Germany, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for "the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly" and free activity of democratic parties and organisations. James Warburg observed that the Soviet proposal might be a bluff, but it seemed "that our government is afraid to call the bluff for the fear that it may not be a bluff at all" and might lead to "a free, neutral, and demilitarised Germany", which might be "subverted into Soviet orbit". This led to an exchange of notes between the Western allies and the Soviet Union, which eventually ended after the Western allies' insistence that a unified Germany should be free to join the European Defence Community and be rearmed, a demand which Stalin rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8204301;The Berlin Wall was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Construction of the wall was commenced by the German Democratic Republic on 13 August 1961. The Wall cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany, including East Berlin. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails, and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the people" from building a socialist state in East Germany. Before the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8204302;The Berlin Wall was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Construction of the wall was commenced by the German Democratic Republic on 13 August 1961. With the closing of the east-west sector boundary in Berlin, the vast majority of East Germans could no longer travel or emigrate to West Germany. Berlin soon went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult. United States and UK sources had expected the Soviet sector to be sealed off from West Berlin, but were surprised by how long the East Germans took for such a move. They considered the Wall as an end to concerns about a GDR/Soviet retaking or capture of the whole of Berlin, the Wall would presumably have been an unnecessary project if such plans were afloat. Thus, they concluded that the possibility of a Soviet military conflict over Berlin had decreased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500700;The Berlin Crisis of 1961 occurred between 4 June - 9 November 1961, and was the last major politic-military European incident of the Cold War about the occupational status of the German capital city, Berlin, and of post-World War II Germany. The Berlin Crisis started when the USSR launched an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in West Berlin. The crisis culminated in the city's de facto partition with the East German erection of the Berlin Wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8204040;The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany would inevitably fall under Soviet Domination so American planners privately decided during the war that it would need a strong, allied Germany to assist in the rebuilding of the West European economy. Anticipating the introduction of a new currency by the other countries in the non-Soviet zones, the Soviet Union in May 1948 directed its military to introduce its own new currency and to permit only the Soviet currency to be used in their sector of Berlin, if the other countries brought in a different currency there. On 18 June the United States, Britain and France announced that on 21 June the Deutsche Mark would be introduced, but the Soviets refused to permit its use as legal tender in Berlin. The Allies had already transported 250,000,000 Deutsche marks into the city and it quickly became the standard currency in all four sectors. Against the wishes of the Soviets, the new currency, along with the Marshall Plan that backed it, appeared to have the potential to revitalise Germany. Stalin looked to force the Western nations to abandon Berlin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500601;The day after the 18 June 1948 announcement of the new Deutsche Mark, Soviet guards halted all passenger trains and traffic on the autobahn to Berlin, delayed Western and German freight shipments and required that all water transport secure special Soviet permission. On 21 June, the day the Deutsche Mark was introduced, the Soviet military halted a United States military supply train to Berlin and sent it back to western Germany. On 22 June, the Soviets announced that they would introduce a new currency in their zone. On 24 June, the Soviets severed land and water connections between the non-Soviet zones and Berlin. That same day, they halted all rail and barge traffic in and out of Berlin. The West answered by introducing a counter-blockade, stopping all rail traffic into East Germany from the British and US zones. Surface traffic from non-Soviet zones to Berlin was blockaded, leaving open only the air corridors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500603;On 24 June, the Soviets severed land and water connections between the non-Soviet zones and Berlin. At the time, West Berlin had 36 days' worth of food, and 45 days' worth of coal. Militarily, the Americans and British were greatly outnumbered because of the postwar scaling back of their armies. Although the ground routes had never been negotiated, the same was not true of the air. On 30 November 1945, it had been agreed in writing that there would be three twenty-mile-wide air corridors providing free access to Berlin. Additionally, unlike a force of tanks and trucks, the Soviets could not claim that cargo aircraft were a military threat. On 24 June 1948 LeMay appointed Brigadier General Joseph Smith, headquarters commandant for USAFE at Camp Lindsey, as the Provisional Task Force Commander of the airlift. Smith had been chief of staff in LeMay's B-29 command in India during World War II and had no airlift experience. On 25 June 1948 Clay gave the order to launch Operation Vittles. By 1 July, the system was getting under way. C-54s were starting to arrive in quantity, and Rhein-Main Air Base became exclusively a C-54 hub, while Wiesbaden retained a mix of C-54s and C-47s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8203004;After the Second World War, there has been no serious effort among the citizens or political parties to unite Germany and Austria. In addition, the Austrian State Treaty forbids such a union and the constitution required Austria's neutrality. A 1987 survey revealed that only 6% of Austrians identified themselves as 'Germans'. Austria began to develop a separate national identity from Germany, although both countries continued to co-operate closely in economic and cultural fields during the Cold War. Moreover, political relations between both countries have been strong and amicable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS_SCA_flag;The Second Control Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8203000;On 28 June 1946, the Allies signed the Second Control Agreement that loosened their dominance over the Austrian government. The Parliament was de facto relieved of Allied control. From now on its decision could be overturned only by unanimous vote by all four Allies. Soviet vetoes were routinely voided by Western opposition. For the next nine years the country was gradually emancipated from foreign control, and evolved from a "nation under tutelage" to full independence. The government possessed its own independent vision of the future, reacting to adverse circumstances and at times turning them to their own benefit. The first allied talks on Austrian independence were held in January 1947, and deadlocked over the issue of "German assets" in Soviet possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8203003;After the war the Allies decided that the province would remain a part of Italy, under the condition that the German-speaking population be granted a significant level of self-government. Italy and Austria negotiated an agreement in 1946, recognising the rights of the German minority. Alcide De Gasperi, Italy's prime minister, a native of Trentino, wanted to extend the autonomy to his fellow citizens. This led to the creation of the region called Trentino-Alto Adige/Tiroler Etschland. The Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement of September 1946 was signed by the Italian and Austrian Foreign Ministers, creating the autonomous region of Trentino-South Tyrol, consisting of the autonomous provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol. German and Italian were both made official languages, and German-language education was permitted once more. Still Italians were the majority in the combined region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8004101;King Paul of Greece declared that Cyprus desired union with Greece in 1948. A referendum was presented by the Orthodox Church of Cyprus in 1950, according to which around 97% of the Greek Cypriot population wanted the union. The Greek petition and enosis became an international issue when it was accepted by the United Nations. Signed on 19 February 1959, the London and Zurich Agreements started the process for the constitution of an independent Cyprus. The United Kingdom granted independence to Cyprus on 16 August 1960 and formed the Republic of Cyprus. Archbishop Makarios III, a charismatic religious and political leader, was elected as the first president of independent Cyprus. As part of the independence agreement, the United Kingdom retained possession of the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia as a British Overseas Territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8004110;Greece had established a national policy of enosis to achieve the island's union with Greece since the 1950s. After 1964, the Greek government tried to control Makarios' policies, and following his unwillingness to obey Athens, attempted to destabilise his government. While the Greek policy shifted to a more cooperative one after 1967, when an extremist military junta took power in Greece, it supported the far-right EOKA-B group against Makarios. Dimitrios Ioannidis, the de facto leader of the junta, believed that Makarios was no longer a true supporter of enosis, and suspected him of being a communist sympathiser. Between 1971 and 1974, five plans were prepared by the Greek government to overthrow Makarios' government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8004111;The coup was ordered by Dimitrios Ioannidis, the shadow leader of the Greek junta, and Greek officers led the Cypriot National Guard to capture the Presidential Palace in Nicosia. The building was almost entirely burned down. Makarios narrowly escaped death in the attack. He fled the presidential palace from its back door and went to Paphos, where the British managed to retrieve him in the afternoon of 16 July and flew him from Akrotiri to Malta. The newly established regime has been described as an extremist puppet regime of the Greek junta. On 15 July, between 8 am and 9 am, the coup leaders proclaimed their victory on the state channel Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation. In response, Rauf Denktas, the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Administration, stated that he believed that the events were among Greek Cypriots and called for Turkish Cypriots not to go out, as well as for UNFICYP to take extensive security measures for Turkish Cypriots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8004112;The Cypriot coup had been ordered by the military Junta in Greece and staged by the Cypriot National Guard in conjunction with EOKA-B. It deposed the Cypriot president Archbishop Makarios III and installed Nikos Sampson. The aim of the coup was the union (enosis) of Cyprus with Greece, and the Hellenic Republic of Cyprus to be declared. In July 1974, Turkish forces invaded and captured 3% of the island before a ceasefire was declared. The Greek military junta collapsed and was replaced by a democratic government. In August 1974 another Turkish invasion resulted in the capture of approximately 36% of the island. The ceasefire line from August 1974 became the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus and is commonly referred to as the Green Line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8004100;The Cyprus Emergency was a conflict fought in British Cyprus between 1955 and 1959. The National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA), a Greek Cypriot right-wing nationalist guerrilla organisation, began an armed campaign in support of the end of British colonial rule and the unification of Cyprus and Greece (Enosis) in 1955. Opposition to Enosis from Turkish Cypriots led to the formation of the Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT) in support of the partition of Cyprus. The Cyprus Emergency ended in 1959 with the signature of the London-Zurich Agreements, establishing the Republic of Cyprus as a non-partitioned independent state separate from Greece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80158461;The Republic of New Afrika (RNA) is a black nationalist organisation and black separatist movement in the United States popularised by black freedom fighter groups. The vision for this country was first promulgated by the Malcolm X Society on March 31, 1968, at a Black Government Conference held in Detroit, Michigan. The conference participants drafted a constitution and declaration of independence, and they identified five Southern states (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina) as subjugated national territory. The organisation was involved in numerous controversial issues. For example, it attempted to assist Oceanhill-Brownsville area in Brooklyn to secede from the United States during the 1968 conflict over control of public schools. Additionally, it was involved with shootouts at New Bethel Baptist Church in 1969 (during the one-year anniversary of the founding) and another in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1971. In the confrontations, law-enforcement officials were killed and injured. Organisation members were prosecuted for the crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8003300;The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960. On 1 July Lumumba sent a wire to the UN to request membership, stating that the Congo "accepts without reservation the obligations stipulated in the Charter of the UN and undertakes to abide by the same in absolute good faith." UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold cabled the Foreign Ministry, pointing out the difficulty in admitting the country into the UN under its name in the face of another application for membership from the neighboring Congo, preparing for independence from French control. A delegation was sent from Brazzaville, the capital of the French Congo, to Leopoldville to resolve the matter. In the end, it was decided that the former Belgian Congo would be recognised as the Republic of the Congo or Congo-Leopoldville while the former French Congo would be known as the Congolese Republic or Congo-Brazzaville.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8003311;During the Congo Crisis, Mobutu, serving as Chief of Staff of the Army and supported by Belgium and the United States, deposed the democratically elected government of nationalist Patrice Lumumba in 1960. Mobutu installed a government that arranged for Lumumba's execution in 1961, and continued to lead the country's armed forces until he took power directly in a second coup in 1965 to become the country's military dictator. To consolidate his power, he established the Popular Movement of the Revolution as the sole legal political party in 1967, changed the Congo's name to Zaire in 1971, and his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu claimed that his political ideology was "neither left nor right, nor even centre" but in practice he developed a totalitarian regime, amassed vast personal wealth, and attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence through his program of "national authenticity".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8003329;A nationalist movement in the Belgian Congo demanded the end of colonial rule: this led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as federalism, tribalism, and ethnic nationalism, remained unresolved. In the first week of July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites. Katanga and South Kasai seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold refused to use these troops to help the central government in Leopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisers and other support. The involvement of the Soviets split the Congolese government and led to an impasse between Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8003335;Members of the MNC-L fled to Stanleyville where, led by Antoine Gizenga, they formed a rebel government in November 1960 in opposition to the central government in Leopoldville. Lumumba escaped house arrest and fled eastwards towards Stanleyville where he believed he could rally support. Pursued by troops loyal to Mobutu, he was captured at Lodi on 1 December 1960 and flown back to Leopoldville with his hands bound. Despite UN appeals to Kasa-Vubu for due legal process, the Soviet Union denounced the UN as responsible for the arrest and demanded his release. A meeting of the UN Security Council was called on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba's immediate release, his restoration to the head of the Congolese government and the disarming of Mobutu's forces. The pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8-2. Still in captivity, Lumumba was tortured and transported to Thysville and later to Katanga, where he was handed over to forces loyal to Tshombe. On 17 January 1961, Lumumba was executed by Katangese troops near Elisabethville.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8003338;On 18 September 1961, Hammarskjold was en route to negotiate a cease-fire between United Nations Operation in the Congo forces and Katangese troops under Moise Tshombe. His Douglas DC-6 airliner SE-BDY crashed near Ndola, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Hammarskjold perished in the crash, as did all but one of the 16 passengers, who died from injuries a few days later. Hammarskjold's death set off a succession crisis at the United Nations, as there was no line of succession and the Security Council had to vote on a successor. The circumstances of the crash are still unclear. A 1962 Rhodesian inquiry concluded that pilot error was to blame, while a later UN investigation could not determine the cause of the crash. There is evidence suggesting the plane was shot down. A CIA report claimed the KGB was responsible. The day after the crash, former U.S. President Harry Truman commented that Hammarskjold "was on the point of getting something done when they killed him. Notice that I said 'when they killed him'.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8003339;Following the Congo Crisis, negotiations between politicians resulted in the drafting of a new constitution. The new document created a presidential system of government in place of the previous semi-presidential system, where both the Prime Minister and President had certain powers. It also made the country more federalist, and increased the number of provinces from six to 21. The country was renamed the "Democratic Republic of Congo" (having been officially the "Republic of Congo" since independence in 1960, a name shared by its neighbour).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8003312;Authenticite was an official state ideology of the Mobutu regime that originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in what was first the Democratic Republic of Congo, later renamed Zaire. The authenticity campaign was an effort to rid the country of the lingering vestiges of colonialism and the continuing influence of Western culture and to create a more centralized and singular national identity. The policy, as implemented, included numerous changes to the state and to private life, including the renaming of the Congo and its cities, as well as an eventual mandate that Zairians were to abandon their Christian names for more "authentic" ones. In addition, Western style attire was banned and replaced with the Mao-style tunic labeled the "abacost" and its female equivalent. The policy began to wane in the late 1970s and had mostly been abandoned by 1990. The most widely recognised result of authenticite was the renaming of the nation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Zaire, a Portuguese mispronunciation of the Kikongo word nzere or nzadi, which translates as "the river that swallows all rivers." It is not known for certain why President Mobutu chose a Portuguese colonial name instead of an authentic Congolese name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8002912;In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main event that united Taiwan's opposition. Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's son and successor as the president, began reforms to the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT. A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan. After the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him and became the first president born in Taiwan. Lee continued the democratic reforms to the government and decreased the concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8002911;Under Chiang, the government recognised limited civil liberties, economic freedoms, property rights (personal and intellectual) and other liberties. Despite these restrictions, free debate within the confines of the legislature was permitted. Under the pretext that new elections could not be held in Communist-occupied constituencies, the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan members held their posts indefinitely. The Temporary Provisions also allowed Chiang to remain as president beyond the two-term limit in the Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610131;The UN system is based on five principal organs: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the International Court of Justice and the UN Secretariat. A sixth principal organ, the Trusteeship Council, suspended operations on 1 November 1994, upon the independence of Palau, the last remaining UN trustee territory. Four of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City. The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi. Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. On the basis of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's impartiality with regard to the host and member countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

stop_spez_participate_desc;A special economic zone (SEZ) is an area in which business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country. SEZs are located within a country's national borders, and their aims include: increased trade, increased investment, job creation and effective administration. To encourage businesses to set up in the zone, financial policies are introduced. These policies typically regard investing, taxation, trading, quotas, customs and labour regulations. Additionally, companies may be offered tax holidays, where upon establishing in a zone they are granted a period of lower taxation. The creation of special economic zones by the host country may be motivated by the desire to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). The benefits a company gains by being in a special economic zone may mean it can produce and trade goods at a lower price, aimed at being globally competitive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8015844;At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954 under the leadership of Earl Warren struck down many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States as unconstitutional. Between 1955 and 1968, nonviolent mass protests and civil disobedience produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to immediately respond to these situations, which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans across the country. In the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests. The social movement's major nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015845;As 1968 began, the fair housing bill was being filibustered once again, but two developments revived it. The Kerner Commission report on the 1967 ghetto riots was delivered to Congress on March 1, and it strongly recommended "a comprehensive and enforceable federal open housing law" as a remedy to the civil disturbances. The Senate was moved to end their filibuster that week. James Lawson invited Martin Luther King to Memphis, Tennessee, in March 1968 to support a sanitation workers' strike. King considered their struggle to be a vital part of the Poor People's Campaign he was planning. A day after delivering his stirring "I've Been to the Mountaintop" sermon, which has become famous for his vision of American society, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in black neighborhoods in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. The House passed the legislation on April 10, less than a week after King was murdered, and President Johnson signed it the next day.

EVTDESC8002840;The Tiananmen Square protests were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square in Beijing during 1989. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the 1989 Democracy Movement. The protests were set off by the death of pro-reform Communist general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social changes in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. As the protests developed, the authorities responded with both conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership. Ultimately, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese Communist Party elders believed the protests to be a political threat and resolved to use force. The State Council declared martial law on May 20 and mobilised as many as 300,000 troops to Beijing. The troops advanced into central parts of Beijing on the city's major thoroughfares in the early morning hours of June 4, killing both demonstrators and bystanders in the process. The international community, human rights organizations, and political analysts condemned the Chinese government for the massacre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8200104;The US strongly supported the Kuomintang forces. About 50,000 US soldiers were sent to guard strategic sites in Hupeh and Shandong in Operation Beleaguer.

According to William Blum, American aid included substantial amounts of mostly surplus military supplies, and loans were made to the KMT. Within less than two years after the Sino-Japanese War, the KMT had received $4.43 billion from the US-most of which was military aid.

EVTDESC8009734;While Mahathir had vanquished his rival Anwar Ibrahim, it came at a cost to his standing in the international community and domestic politics. UMNO lost 18 seats and two state governments as large numbers of Malay voters flocked to PAS and Keadilan, many in protest at the treatment of Anwar. At UMNO's general assembly in 2002, he announced that he would resign as prime minister, only for supporters to rush to the stage and convince him tearfully to remain. He subsequently fixed his retirement for October 2003, giving him time to ensure an orderly and uncontroversial transition to his anointed successor, Abdullah Badawi. In a speech made before the Organization of the Islamic Conference shortly before he left office, Mahathir claimed "the Jews rule the world by proxy: They get others to fight and die for them." His speech was denounced by President George W. Bush. Having spent over 22 years in office, Mahathir was the world's longest-serving elected leader when he retired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009736;Najib's response to the corruption accusations has been to tighten his grip on power by replacing the deputy prime minister, suspending two newspapers and pushing through parliament a controversial National Security Council Bill that provides the prime minister with unprecedented powers. Najib's various subsidy cuts have contributed to soaring living costs, while fluctuating oil prices as well as fallout from the 1MDB scandal have led to a steady depreciation of the Malaysian currency. These ended with a loss of majority for Dewan Rakyat by BN in the 2018 general elections, which Najib then accepted the results of the election and promised to help facilitate a smooth transition of power. On 3 July 2018, Najib was arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), having investigated how RM42 million (USD 10.6 million) went from SRC International, a company related to 1MDB, into Najib's bank account. In the process, the police had seized a number of fashion accessories worth 273 million while searching through his properties. Najib was subsequently charged with abuse of power, multiple counts of criminal breach of trust and money laundering, and tampering with the 1MDB audit report.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009737;In 2018, Mahathir was announced as the Pakatan Harapan coalition candidate for prime minister for the 2018 general election, in a plan to pardon Anwar Ibrahim and hand a role to him if the campaign was successful. Following a decisive victory for Pakatan Harapan in the 2018 election, Mahathir was sworn in as prime minister. He was the first prime minister not to represent the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition (or its predecessor, the Alliance Party) and also the first to serve from two different parties and on non-consecutive terms. He campaigned on a promise to hand over the Prime Ministership to Anwar Ibrahim of the PKR party after 2 years but he walked back those words.

EVTDESC8009738;The crisis started when several political parties joined forces and tried to form a new government by claiming majority seats and support in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower chamber of the bicameral Parliament of Malaysia, without going through a general election. It was accomplished through the withdrawal of the Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) from the Pakatan Harapan coalition and through the support of several MPs from the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) led by its deputy president Azmin Ali who left the party. The prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad resigned as a result. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Abdullah of Pahang, then met with all MPs and political party leaders to gauge their support for a new prime minister. He ultimately appointed the president of Bersatu, Muhyiddin Yassin, as the 8th prime minister. Muhyiddin then declared his coalition government as Perikatan Nasional.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1214002;On 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947. The new country was named the Union of Burma, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first president and U Nu as its first prime minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the Commonwealth. A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities, and multi-party elections were held in 1951-1952, 1956 and 1960. The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement, which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8002304;When the non-Burman ethnic groups pushed for autonomy or federalism, alongside having a weak civilian government at the centre, the military leadership plotted a coup d'etat. On 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d'etat, and the government has been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general. Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were nationalised or brought under government control under the Burmese Way to Socialism, which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80023131;Saffron Revolution was a series of economic and political protests and demonstrations that took place during August, September, and October 2007 in Myanmar. The protests were triggered by the decision of the national military government to remove subsidies on the sales prices of fuel. The national government is the only supplier of fuels and the removal of the price subsidy immediately caused diesel and petrol prices to increase by 66-100% and the price of compressed natural gas for buses to increase 500% in less than a week. The various protests were led by students, political activists, including women, and Buddhist monks and took the form of a campaign of nonviolent resistance, sometimes also called civil resistance. In response to the protests dozens of protesters were arrested or detained. Starting in September 2007 the protests were led by thousands of Buddhist monks, and those protests were allowed to proceed until a renewed government crackdown in late September 2007.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8002309;Ne Win ruled Burma as a de facto dictator as Chairman of the BSPP and other top offices including Prime Minister and President. Burma was renamed the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma and the Union Revolutionary Council was replaced with the People's Assembly in 1974. The Burmese Way to Socialism was characterised by totalitarianism, superstition, xenophobia, sinophobia, and the rejection of Cold War politics. The policy sought to reorganize the Burmese economy to a socialist economy, to develop the Burmese military, and to construct a national identity among many disparate ethnic minorities and the majority Burmans. Ne Win further strengthened socialist rule in Burma through the 1974 Constitution which reformed the nation into the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma and adopting more communist reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of the most important events of the 19th century was the rise of Indian nationalism, leading Indians to seek first "self-rule" and later "complete independence". Late in 1946, the Labour government decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947 Britain announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948 and participating in the formation of an interim government. With the independence of India from British rule, the subcontinent is once again under the rightful rule of the Indians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005730;The May 1958 crisis was a political crisis in France during the turmoil of the Algerian War of Independence (1954-62) which led to the collapse of the Fourth Republic and its replacement by the Fifth Republic led by Charles de Gaulle who returned to power after a twelve-year absence. It started as a political uprising in Algiers on 13 May 1958 and then became a military coup d'etat led by a coalition headed by Algiers deputy and reserve airborne officer Pierre Lagaillarde, French Generals Raoul Salan, Edmond Jouhaud, Jean Gracieux, and Jacques Massu, and by Admiral Philippe Auboyneau, commander of the Mediterranean fleet. The coup was supported by former Algerian Governor General Jacques Soustelle and his activist allies. The coup had as its aim to oppose the formation of Pierre Pflimlin's new government and to impose a change of policies in favor of the right-wing partisans of French Algeria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005733;The Programme commun was a reform programme, signed 27 June 1972 by the Socialist Party, the French Communist Party and the centrist Radical Movement of the Left, which provided a great upheaval in the economic, political and military fields in France. That alliance opened a political repositioning for the left that lasted 30 years, contributing particularly to the election of Francois Mitterrand in the presidential election of 1981. Between 1981 and 1983, he began putting Programme commun into action. The Keynesian-inspired policies led to an increase in the fiscal deficit and the trade deficit. To keep France in the European Monetary System, a different approach was needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610126;In 1999, the Government of the United Kingdom invited British Dependent Territories to provide proposals for constitutional reform. A cross-party committee of the Gibraltar House of Assembly was set up to consult with interested parties and in January 2002 produced a report, which was subsequently debated and negotiated with the United Kingdom. The proposals for the reform were accepted by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in March 2006 and then were unanimously approved in the House of Assembly in October. Among changes introduced by the new constitution were: Removal of the two remaining un-elected members of the House of Assembly. Increasing the number of elected representatives from 15 to 17, with the parliament able to legislate to increase this number. Decreasing the Governor's powers, and transferring some of these to elected officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610127;A referendum on becoming an autonomous overseas territory was held in French Guiana on 10 January 2010. The proposal was rejected by 70% of voters who prefer full integration in the French central state. The turnout was 48%. French President Nicolas Sarkozy proposed the referendum after visiting the Caribbean island of Martinique in June 2009. French Guiana was an overseas region and an overseas department of France, regulated by the article 73 of the French Constitution, giving it the same political status as metropolitan departments and regions. The proposed change would have led to it becoming an overseas collectivity, regulated by the article 74 of the French Constitution, similar to French Polynesia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005027;In early 2014, David Cameron outlined the changes he aimed to bring about in the EU and in the UK's relationship with it. These were: additional immigration controls, especially for citizens of new EU member states, tougher immigration rules for present EU citizens, new powers for national parliaments collectively to veto proposed EU laws, new free-trade agreements and a reduction in bureaucracy for businesses, a lessening of the influence of the European Court of Human Rights on British police and courts, more power for individual member states, and less for the central EU, and abandonment of the EU notion of "ever closer union". He intended to bring these about during a series of negotiations with other EU leaders and then, if re-elected, to announce a referendum. In May 2015, following a Conservative Party manifesto pledge, the legal basis for the EU referendum was established through the European Union Referendum Act 2015. Britain Stronger in Europe became the official group campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, and was endorsed by the Prime Minister Cameron and Chancellor Osborne. Vote Leave was the official group campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, and was fronted by Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, along with Labour MP Gisela Stuart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005028;The final result was announced on Friday 24 June 2016 at 07:20 BST by then-Electoral Commission Chairwoman Jenny Watson at Manchester Town Hall after all 382 voting areas and the twelve UK regions had declared their totals. With a national turnout of 72% across the United Kingdom and Gibraltar (representing 33,577,342 people), at least 16,788,672 votes were required to win a majority. The electorate voted to "Leave the European Union", with a majority of 1,269,501 votes (3.8%) over those who voted "Remain a member of the European Union". The national turnout of 72% was the highest ever for a UK-wide referendum, and the highest for any national vote since the 1992 general election. After the UK EU membership referendum held on 23 June 2016, in which a majority voted to leave the European Union, the United Kingdom experienced political and economic upsets, with spillover effects across the rest of the European Union and the wider world. Prime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned for Remain, announced his resignation on 24 June, triggering a Conservative leadership election, won by Home Secretary Theresa May.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005029;The Brexit withdrawal agreement is a treaty between the European Union (EU), Euratom, and the United Kingdom (UK), signed on 24 January 2020, setting the terms of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and Euratom. The Agreement covers such matters as money, citizens' rights, border arrangements and dispute resolution. It also contains a transition period and an outline of the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period until 31 December 2020, during which time the UK remains in the single market, in order to ensure frictionless trade until a long-term relationship is agreed. Boris Johnson renegotiated the deal in 2019 and as a result, the Irish backstop was removed, and replaced by a new protocol on Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland. In this, the whole of the UK comes out of the EU Customs Union as a single customs territory, with Northern Ireland included in any future UK trade deals. However, Northern Ireland adopts EU Single Market regulations on goods in order to prevent a hard border and remains an entry point into the EU Customs Union. This leads to a de jure customs border on the island of Ireland, but a de facto customs border down the Irish Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80050191;The Suez Crisis badly damaged Eden's reputation for statesmanship, and led to a breakdown in his health. He went on vacation to Jamaica in November 1956, at a time when he was still determined to soldier on as prime minister. The Observer newspaper accused Eden of lying to Parliament over the Suez Crisis, while MPs from all parties criticised his calling a ceasefire before the Canal was taken. Churchill, while publicly supportive of Eden's actions, privately criticised his successor for not seeing the military operation through to its conclusion. Eden easily survived a vote of confidence in the House of Commons on 8 November. On his return from Jamaica on 14 December, Eden still hoped to continue as prime minister. He had lost his traditional base of support on the Tory left and amongst moderate opinion nationally, but appears to have hoped to rebuild a new base of support amongst the Tory Right. However his health continued to decline. Eden resigned on 9 January 1957, after his doctors warned him his life was at stake if he continued in office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80050192;Sir Winston Churchill died on 24 January 1965, aged 90. His was the first state funeral for a non-royal family member since Lord Carson in 1935, and as of 2020 it remains the most recent state funeral in the United Kingdom. The official funeral lasted for four days. Planning for the funeral, known as Operation Hope Not, began 12 years before Churchill's death. It was initiated after Churchill's stroke in 1953 while in his second term as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. After several revisions due to Churchill's continued survival, the plan was issued on 26 January 1965, two days after his death. By decree of Queen Elizabeth II, his body lay in state at Westminster Hall for three days from 26 January. On 30 January, the order of funeral was held at St Paul's Cathedral. From there the body was transported by water along the River Thames to Waterloo station, accompanied by military salutations. In the afternoon he was buried at St Martin's Churchyard at Bladon, the resting place of his ancestors and his brother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80050221;On the early morning of 12 October 1984, the day before her 59th birthday, Thatcher escaped injury in the Brighton hotel bombing during the Conservative Party Conference when the hotel was bombed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Five people died in the attack, including Roberta Wakeham, wife of the Government's Chief Whip John Wakeham, and Conservative MP Sir Anthony Berry. A prominent member of the Cabinet, Norman Tebbit, was injured, and his wife Margaret was left paralysed. Thatcher herself escaped assassination by sheer luck. She insisted that the conference open on time the next day and made her speech as planned in defiance of the bombers, a gesture which won widespread approval across the political spectrum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005024;Throughout 1990, the popularity both of Thatcher and her Conservative government waned considerably. The introduction of the deeply unpopular Community Charge (which opponents labelled the "poll tax") had been greeted with widespread non-payment and even a riot in Trafalgar Square in March 1990. Labour had held a lead in most of the opinion polls since mid-1989, and at the height of the poll tax controversy, at least one opinion poll had shown Labour support above 50%, a lead of more than 20 points over the Conservatives, although the Conservative parliamentary majority still stood at nearly 100 seats. This culminated into the 1990 Conservative Party leadership election following the decision of Michael Heseltine, former Defence and Environment Secretary, to challenge Margaret Thatcher, the incumbent Prime Minister, for leadership of the Conservative Party. Thatcher failed to win outright under the terms of the election in the first ballot, and was persuaded to withdraw from the second round of voting. She announced her resignation on the morning of 22 November 1990, ending more than 15 years as Conservative leader and 11 years as Prime Minister.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005025;The term New Labour was coined by Tony Blair in his October 1994 Labour Party Conference speech as part of the slogan "New Labour, New Britain". During this speech, Blair announced the modification of Clause IV of the party's constitution which abandoned Labour's attachment to nationalisation and embraced market economics. The new version of the clause committed Labour to a balance of market and public ownership and to balance creation of wealth with social justice. Blair argued for increased modernisation at the conference, asserting that "parties that do not change die, and Labour is a living movement not a historical monument". During the period from 1994 to 1997, after Blair's election as party leader, Labour managed to reverse decades of decline in party membership by increasing the number by around 40%, increasing its capacity to compete for office whilst also legitimising the leadership of Blair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005026;On 5 September 2006, a letter signed by 17 Labour MPs called for Tony Blair to resign due to rising discontent with his intervention in the Second Iraq War and rivarly with his Chancellor Gordon Brown. On 11 May 2007, after months of speculation, Gordon Brown formally announced his bid for the Labour leadership and replaced Tony Blair as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007. On 16 May, Channel 4 News announced that Andrew MacKinlay had nominated Brown, giving him 308 nominations-enough to avoid a leadership contest. A BBC report states that the decisive nomination was made by Tony Wright with MacKinlay yet to nominate at that point. Following Blair's announcement of his resignation and Brown's bid for leadership, the Labour Party rose in popularity in the polls, gaining three points after months of low polls and trailing behind the opposition Conservative Party. However, Labour subsequently lost this lead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_a_socialist_democracy_title;Enact Democratic Socialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_a_socialist_democracy_desc;Democratic socialism is a political philosophy that advocates political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production with an emphasis on self-management and democratic management of economic institutions within a market socialist, participatory or decentralised planned economy. Democratic socialists hold that capitalism is inherently incompatible with what they hold to be the democratic values of liberty, equality and solidarity and that these ideals can only be achieved through the realisation of a socialist society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC801262211;Beginning in 1968, following the 1964 recommendations of the commission headed by Fox Odendaal, ten homelands similar to those in South Africa were established in South West Africa (present-day Namibia). The term "Bantustan" is somewhat inappropriate in this context, since some of the peoples involved were Khoisan not Bantu, and the Rehoboth Basters are a complex case. Of these ten South West African homelands, only three were granted self-government (comparable to the Bantustans in South Africa) between 1973 and 1976. In July 1980 the system was changed to one of separate governments ("representative authorities") as second-tier administrative units (responsible for a number of affairs like land tenure, agriculture, education up to the level of primary school teachers' training, health services, and social welfare and pensions) on the basis of ethnicity only and no longer based on geographically defined areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005018;The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King's health, made worse by his heavy smoking and subsequent development of lung cancer among other ailments, including arteriosclerosis and Buerger's disease. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right lumbar sympathectomy in March 1949. On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, the King went to London Airport to see Elizabeth and Philip off on their tour to Australia via Kenya. It was his last public appearance. Six days later, at 07:30 GMT on the morning of 6 February, he was found dead in bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk. He had died in his sleep from a coronary thrombosis. His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II. From 9 February for two days George VI's coffin rested in St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, before lying in state at Westminster Hall from 11 February. His funeral took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on the 15th.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005020;In the latter half of 1967, an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit, which in turn prevented a rise in unemployment. After a costly battle, market pressures forced the government to devalue the pound by 14% from 2.80 to 2.40 in November 1967. Wilson was much criticised for a broadcast soon after in which he assured listeners that the "pound in your pocket" had not lost its value. Economic performance did show some improvement after the devaluation, as economists had predicted. The devaluation, with accompanying austerity measures which ensured resources went into exports rather than domestic consumption, successfully restored the trade balance to surplus by 1969. In retrospect Wilson has been widely criticised for not devaluing earlier, however, he believed there were strong arguments against it, including the fear that it would set off a round of competitive devaluations, and concern about the impact price rises following a devaluation would have on people on low incomes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80050201;The Industrial Relations Act 1971 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, since repealed. It was based on proposals outlined in the governing Conservative Party's manifesto for the 1970 general election. The goal was to stabilise industrial relations by forcing concentration of bargaining power and responsibility in the formal union leadership, using the courts. The act was intensely opposed by unions, and helped undermine the government of Edward Heath. It was repealed in 1974 when the Labour Party returned to government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80050202;$MONARCHTITLE$ Heath tried to bolster his government by calling a general election for 28 February 1974, using the election slogan "Who governs Britain?". The result of the election was inconclusive with no party gaining an overall majority in the House of Commons, the Conservatives had the most votes but Labour had slightly more seats. Heath began negotiations with Jeremy Thorpe, leader of the Liberal Party but, when these failed, he resigned as Prime Minister on 4 March 1974, and was replaced by Wilson's minority Labour government, eventually confirmed, though with a tiny majority, in a second election in October. The incoming Labour government repealed the Act through the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005021;The Winter of Discontent took place during 1978-79 in the United Kingdom. It was characterised by widespread strikes by private, and later public, sector trade unions demanding pay rises greater than the limits Prime Minister James Callaghan and his Labour Party government had been imposing, against Trades Union Congress (TUC) opposition, to control inflation. Some of these industrial disputes caused great public inconvenience, exacerbated by the coldest winter for 16 years, in which severe storms isolated many remote areas of the country. After Callaghan returned from a summit conference in the tropics at a time when the hauliers' strike and the weather had seriously disrupted the economy, leading thousands to apply for unemployment benefits, his denial that there was "mounting chaos" in the country was paraphrased in a famous Sun headline as "Crisis? What Crisis?" Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher's acknowledgement of the severity of the situation in a Party Political Broadcast a week later was seen as instrumental to her victory in the general election held four months later after Callaghan's government fell to a no-confidence vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005022;The miners' strike of 1984-85 was a major industrial action to shut down the British coal industry in an attempt to prevent colliery closures. It was led by Arthur Scargill of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) against the National Coal Board (NCB), a government agency. Opposition to the strike was led by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions. The NUM was divided over the action and many mineworkers, especially in the Midlands, worked through the dispute. Few major trade unions supported the NUM, primarily because of the absence of a vote at national level. Violent confrontations between flying pickets and police characterised the year-long strike, which ended in a decisive victory for the Conservative government and allowed the closure of most of Britain's collieries. Many observers regard the strike as "the most bitter industrial dispute in British history".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005023;The green paper of 1986, Paying for Local Government, produced by the Department of the Environment from consultations between Lord Rothschild, William Waldegrave and Kenneth Baker, proposed the poll tax. This was a fixed tax per adult resident, hence the term 'poll tax', although there was a reduction for poor people. This charged each person for the services provided in their community. Owing to the variations in the amount of local taxes paid and the amount of grant provided by central government to individual local authorities, there were differences in the amount charged between councils. The change from payment based on the worth of one's house to a poll tax was widely criticised as being unfair, and needlessly burdensome on those less well-off. Mass protests were co-ordinated by the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, other national networks such as 3D (Don't Register, Don't Pay, Don't Collect) and by hundreds of local Anti-Poll Tax Unions (APTUs), which were not aligned to any particular political grouping. The most serious of those was on 31 March 1990 - a week before the implementation of the tax - when between 70,000 and 200,000 people demonstrated against the tax. The demonstration around Trafalgar Square left 113 people injured and 340 under arrest, with over 100 police officers needing treatment for injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005017;The Profumo affair was a British political scandal that originated with a brief sexual relationship in 1961, between John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War in Harold Macmillan's Conservative government, and Christine Keeler, a 19-year-old would-be model. In March 1963, Profumo denied any impropriety in a personal statement to the House of Commons, but was forced to admit the truth a few weeks later. He resigned from the government and from Parliament. When the Profumo affair was first revealed, public interest was heightened by reports that Keeler may have been simultaneously involved with Captain Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet naval attache, thereby creating a possible security risk. The repercussions of the affair severely damaged Macmillan's self-confidence, and he resigned as Prime Minister on health grounds in October 1963. The reputation of the Conservative Party was damaged by the scandal, which may have contributed to its defeat by the Labour Party in the 1964 general election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8002315;General elections were held in Myanmar on 8 November 2015, with the National League for Democracy winning a supermajority of seats in the combined national parliament. Voting occurred in all constituencies, excluding seats appointed by the military, to select Members of Assembly to seats in both the upper house (the House of Nationalities) and the lower house (the House of Representatives) of the Assembly of the Union, and State and Region Hluttaws. Ethnic Affairs Ministers were also elected by their designated electorates on the same day, although only select ethnic minorities in particular states and regions were entitled to vote for them. These polls were the first openly contested election held in the country since 1990, which was annulled by the military government after the National League for Democracy's (NLD) victory. The poll was preceded by the 2010 General Election, which was marred by a widespread boycott and allegations of systematic fraud by the victorious Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). Although NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency (as both her late husband and her children are foreign citizens), she is the de facto head of government, after being appointed to a newly created office, the State Counsellor of Myanmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8002314;General elections were held in Myanmar on 7 November 2010, in accordance with the new constitution, which was approved in a referendum held in May 2008. The election date was announced by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) on 13 August. The elections were the fifth step of the seven-step "roadmap to democracy" proposed by the SPDC in 2003, the sixth and seventh steps being the convening of elected representatives and the building of a modern, democratic nation, respectively. However, the National League for Democracy boycotted the elections. The result was a sweeping victory for the Union Solidarity and Development Party, which won nearly 80% of seats contested across the upper and lower houses. The United Nations expressed concern about the fairness of the elections, and western countries dismissed them as fraudulent. Due to the strict separation of powers in the constitution, members elected to the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw were automatically disqualified from their seats if they accepted appointment to an executive or judicial body. As a result, many elected members elected were quickly disqualified from their seats after accepting appointment to bodies such as the Cabinet of Myanmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8002313;The 1990 Myanmar general election was held in Myanmar on 27 May 1990, and was the first multi-party election since 1960, after which the country had been ruled by a military dictatorship. The election was not meant to form a parliamentary government, but rather to form a parliament-sized constitutional committee to draft a new constitution. The election was won convincingly by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), who took 392 of the 492 seats. Initially, the SLORC said it would honour the results of the election to the Pyithu Hluttaw (Legislature). However, later the government, surprised at the outcome, annulled the results and many MPs elected were arrested or went into exile. Some later formed the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma. Two months after the election, the SLORC issued Order 1/90, explaining it had legitimacy to rule as it was recognised by the United Nations and individual countries, as well as ensuring it would prevent the break-up of the Union. It required all parties to recognise and accept the Order, and many opposition figures who refused were arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009605;General elections were held in the Seychelles between 20 and 23 July 1993 following the approval of a new constitution in a referendum on 18 June. They were the first-ever multi-party elections for President and the first multi-party election for the National Assembly since 1974. The Assembly was increased from 22 to 33 seats by the addition of 11 seats to be elected by proportional representation in addition to the 22 constituency seats. The ruling Seychelles People's Progressive Front, which had previously been the sole legal party, won both elections, taking 27 of the 33 seats in the National Assembly, whilst its leader, France-Albert Rene, won the presidential election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009604;The Republic of Seychelles achieved independence on 29 June 1976. James Mancham was president and France-Albert Rene was prime minister, but relations between the two quickly soured. In 1977 Rene's leftist supporters launched an armed coup while Mancham was in London. Though Rene denied any responsibility, he assumed the presidency in June. Two plots were formulated the following year to depose him, but they failed. In 1979 his party won an election and he pursued a socialist agenda, upsetting the small but influential middle class population. His reign also saw the withdrawal of South Africa's landing rights as well as a deterioration of economic ties between the two countries. Rene frequently warned that sympathizers of the old government were conspiring to use mercenaries to stage a counter-coup. At 17:30 on 25 November 1981, Hoare and 43 mercenaries flew into Seychelles International Airport as AOFB members with baggages filled of toys that were to be supposedly distributed to local orphanages at Pointe La Rue on Mahe, under a South African lead operation nicknamed 'Operation Angela'. All but two of the putschists had made it through customs before their cover was blown. The mercenaries then started a six-hour gun battle at the airport. About 70 present airport staff were taken hostage by the mercenaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009603;Earlier today insurgents took control of strategic points on the main island of Mahe, where the capital Victoria is located. The central police station has been seized virtually without a shot being fired. In contrast, there has been an exchange of fire at the Mont Fleuri police station, where the arsenal is kept. A policeman and one of the insurgents have been killed in the fighting./n The plotters have arrested six British Armed Forces officers, who had been advising the Seychelles Police Force since 1976, when Seychelles gained independence from the United Kingdom. Should we surrender or crackdown on those rebels?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009600;In March 1970, colonial and political representatives of Seychelles met in London for a constitutional convention, with the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP) of James Mancham advocating closer integration with the UK, and the Seychelles People's United Party (SPUP) of France-Albert Rene advocating independence. Further elections in November 1970 brought a new constitution into effect, with Mancham as Chief Minister. Further elections were held in April 1974, in which both major political parties campaigned for independence. Following this election, negotiations with the British resulted in an agreement under which the Seychelles became an independent republic within the Commonwealth on June 29, 1976.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8299006;In October 1991, a delegation to East Timor consisting of members of the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal and twelve journalists was planned during a visit from UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights on Torture, Pieter Kooijmans. The Indonesian Government objected to the inclusion in the delegation of Jill Jolliffe, an Australian journalist who it regarded as supportive of the Fretilin independence movement, and Portugal subsequently cancelled the delegation. Tension between Indonesian authorities and East Timorese youths rose in the days after Portugal's cancellation. On 28 October, Indonesian troops had located a group of resistance members in Dili's Motael Church. A confrontation ensued between pro-integration activists and those in the church, when it was over, one man on each side was dead. During a brief confrontation between Indonesian troops and protesters, some protesters and a major, Geerhan Lantara were stabbed. When the procession entered the cemetery some continued their protests before the cemetery wall. Around 200 more Indonesian soldiers arrived and advanced on the gathering, weapons drawn. In the graveyard, they opened fire on hundreds of unarmed civilians. At least 250 East Timorese were killed in the massacre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8000316;In January 1991 following the start of the Gulf War, the FIS led giant demonstrations in support of the Saddam Hussein and Iraq. One ending in front of the Ministry of Defense where radical leader Ali Benhadj gave an impassioned speech demanding a corp of volunteers be sent to fight for Saddam. The Algerian military took this as a direct affront to the military hierarchy and cohesion. After a project to realign electoral districts came to light in May, the FIS called for a general strike. Violence ensued and on 3 June 1991 a state of emergency was declared, many constitutional rights were suspended, and parliamentary elections postponed until December. The FIS participated in the legislative elections and on 26 December 1991 won the first round with 118 deputies elected as opposed to just 16 for the FLN. Despite getting one million fewer votes than it had in 1990 elections. It appeared to be on track to win an absolute majority in the second round on 13 January 1992.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8000317;On 11 January 1992 the army cancelled the electoral process, forcing President Bendjedid to resign and bringing in the exiled independence fighter Mohamed Boudiaf to serve as a new president. However, on 29 June 1992 he was assassinated by one of his bodyguards, Lieutenant Lambarek Boumaarafi. So many FIS members were arrested - 5,000 by the army's account, 40,000 according to Gilles Kepel and including its leader Abdelkader Hachani-that the jails had insufficient space to hold them in, camps were set up for them in the Sahara desert, and bearded men feared to leave their houses lest they be arrested as FIS sympathizers. Of the few FIS activists that remained free, many took this as a declaration of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8206041;Indonesia began landing paratroops onto the territory of Western New Guinea in December 1961 which prompted a political crisis between the Netherlands and Indonesia. The United States mediated in the dispute and this led to the signing of the New York Agreement in September 1962. The agreement pledged to transfer the administration from the Netherlands to a United Nations temporary authority on 1 October 1962, and gave the United Nations a discretion to transfer all or part of the administration to Indonesia. During the seven month transition period Dutch civil servants and officials were slowly recalled to the Netherlands and were replaced by local and Indonesian officials. The transfer of authority took place on 1 May 1963 and West New Guinea became a province of Indonesia known as Irian Barat, later renamed Irian Jaya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1007301;Following the resignation of Indonesian President Suharto, an UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal allowed for an UN-supervised popular referendum in August 1999. A clear vote for independence was met with a punitive campaign of violence by East Timorese pro-integration militia supported by elements of the Indonesian military. On 30 August 2001, the East Timorese voted in their first election organised by the UN to elect members of the Constituent Assembly. On 22 March 2002, the Constituent Assembly approved the Constitution. By May 2002, over 205,000 refugees had returned. On 20 May 2002, the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of East Timor came into force and East Timor was recognised as independent by the UN. The Constituent Assembly was renamed the National Parliament and Xanana Gusmao was sworn in as the country's first President after Indonesian occupation. On 27 September 2002, East Timor was renamed Timor-Leste, using the Portuguese language, and was admitted as a member state by the UN.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007322;The Indonesian invasion of East Timor, known in Indonesia as Operation Lotus, began on 7 December 1975 when the Indonesian military invaded East Timor under the pretext of anti-colonialism. Indonesian nationalist and military hardliners, particularly leaders of the intelligence agency Kopkamtib and special operations unit, Opsus, saw the Portuguese coup as an opportunity for East Timor's annexation by Indonesia. Suharto was originally not in support of an East Timor invasion but such considerations became overshadowed by Indonesian and Western fears that victory for the left-wing Fretilin would lead to the creation of a communist state on Indonesia's border that could be used as a base for incursions by unfriendly powers into Indonesia, and a potential threat to Western submarines. The overthrowing of a popular and briefly Fretilin-led government later sparked a violent quarter-century occupation. During the first months of the occupation, the Indonesian military faced heavy insurgency resistance in the mountainous interior of the island, but from 1977-1978, the military procured new advanced weaponry from the United States, Israel, and other countries, to destroy Fretilin's framework.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8007321;For the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century, with minimal investment in infrastructure, health, and education. Sandalwood continued to be the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with East Timorese resistance. Following the 1974 Portuguese revolution, Portugal effectively abandoned its colony in Timor and civil war between East Timorese political parties broke out in 1975. The Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) resisted a Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) coup attempt in August 1975, and unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8014301;After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. United Nations Security Council Resolution 7, adopted on June 26, 1946, concerned the impact of Spain's dictatorship on international peace and security. The Second World War had ended the year before. The resolution was adopted in parts, and therefore no vote was taken on the text as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201909;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government has decided to remove the strong executive powers that the King currently wields and transfer the power to someone else. The reasons for this act are legion however this has had the effect of ending the Absolute Monarchy that has ruled $COUNTRY$ for some time. The anti-royalists are elated with this development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8299002;With the unifying struggle to secure Indonesia's independence over, divisions in Indonesian society began to appear. These included regional differences in customs, religion, the impact of Christianity and Marxism, and fears of Javanese political domination. In contrast to the 1945 Constitution, the 1950 constitution mandated a parliamentary system of government, an executive responsible to parliament, and stipulated at length constitutional guarantees for human rights, drawing heavily on the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A proliferation of political parties dealing for shares of cabinet seats resulted in a rapid turnover of coalition governments including 17 cabinets between 1945 and 1958.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8299003;Guided Democracy was the political system in place in Indonesia from 1957 until the New Order began in 1966. It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. Sukarno believed that parliamentarian system implemented during the liberal democracy period was ineffective due to Indonesia's divisive political situation at that time. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders. With the introduction of this system, Indonesia returned to the presidential system and Sukarno became the head of government again. Sukarno proposed a threefold blend of nasionalisme ('nationalism'), agama ('religion'), and komunisme ('communism') into a co-operative Nas-A-Kom (or Nasakom) governmental concept. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics - the army, Islamic groups, and the communists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8299004;Throughout the 1965-66 period, President Sukarno attempted to restore his political position and shift the country back to its pre-October 1965 position but his Guided Democracy balancing act was destroyed with the PKI's demise. Although he remained president, the weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who by that time had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) named General Suharto acting president. Suharto was formally appointed president in March 1968. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In the aftermath of Suharto's rise, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or imprisoned by the military and religious groups in a backlash against alleged communist supporters, with direct support from the United States. Suharto's administration is commonly called the New Order era. The features of the "New Order" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009733;By the mid-1990s it had become clear that the most serious threat to Mahathir's power was the leadership ambition of his deputy, Anwar. Anwar began to distance himself from Mahathir, overtly promoting his superior religious credentials and appearing to suggest he favoured loosening the restrictions on civil liberties that had become a hallmark of Mahathir's premiership. However, Mahathir continued to back Anwar as his successor until their relationship collapsed dramatically during the Asian financial crisis. On 2 September, he was dismissed as deputy prime minister and finance minister, and promptly expelled from UMNO. No immediate reasons were given for the dismissal. As more allegations surfaced, large public rallies were held in support of Anwar. On 20 September, he was arrested and placed in detention under the Internal Security Act. Anwar stood trial on four charges of corruption, arising from allegations that Anwar abused his power by ordering police to intimidate persons who had alleged Anwar had sodomised them. Before Anwar's trial, Mahathir told the press that he was convinced of Anwar's guilt. He was found guilty in April 1999 and sentenced to six years in prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009730;Mahathir bin Mohamad is a Malaysian politician and statesman who served as the 4th and 7th Prime Minister of Malaysia from July 1981 to October 2003 and from May 2018 to March 2020. During Mahathir's first tenure as prime minister, Malaysia experienced a period of rapid modernisation and economic growth, and his government initiated a series of bold infrastructure projects. Mahathir was a dominant political figure, winning five consecutive general elections and fending off a series of rivals for the leadership of UMNO.However, his accumulation of power came at the expense of judicial independence and the traditional powers and privileges of Malaysia's royalty. He used the controversial Internal Security Act to detain activists, non-mainstream religious figures, and political opponents, including the deputy prime minister whom he fired in 1998, Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir's record of curbing civil liberties and his antagonism towards western interests and economic policy made his relationships with western nations difficult. As prime minister, he was an advocate of third-world development and a prominent international activist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009731;In 1983, Mahathir commenced the first of a number of battles he would have with Malaysia's royalty during his premiership. The position of Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Malaysian head of state, was due to rotate in to either the elderly Idris Shah II of Perak or the controversial Iskandar of Johor, who had only a few years earlier been convicted of manslaughter. Thus Mahathir had grave reservations about the two Sultans, who were both activist rulers of their own states. Mahathir tried to pre-emptively limit the power that the new Agong could wield over his government, introducing to parliament amendments to the Constitution to deem the Agong to assent to any bill that had not been assented within 15 days of passage by Parliament. Supported by the Sultans, the Agong refused to assent to the constitutional amendments, which had by then passed both houses of Parliament with comfortable majorities. When the public became aware of the impasse, and the Sultans refused to compromise with the government, Mahathir took to the streets to demonstrate public support for his position in mass rallies. The crisis was resolved after five months as Mahathir and the Sultans agreed to a compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009732;Operation Lalang is a major crackdown carried out beginning 27 October 1987 by the Royal Malaysian Police, ostensibly to prevent the occurrence of racial riots in Malaysia. The operation saw the arrest of 106 to 119 people - NGO activists, opposition politicians, intellectuals, students, artists, scientists and others - who were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA). It was the second largest ISA swoop in Malaysian history since the 13 May riots. The Malaysian government argued that racial tension had reach dangerous proportion in the country, forcing the government to arrest those responsible for stoking the tension. The notion that racial riots were imminent however is contested, and it is widely believed that the operation was designed to control the political opponents of the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad through draconian measures. The event marked the beginning of a period of Mahathir's authoritarian rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009729;The New Economic Policy (NEP) was a social re-engineering and affirmative action program formulated by the National Operations Council (NOC) in the aftermath of 13 May Incident in Malaysia. This policy was adopted in 1971 for a period of 20 years and it was succeeded by the National Development Policy (NDP) in 1991. The NEP was conceived as a two-pronged strategy for eradicating poverty for all Malaysians as well as reducing and subsequently eliminating identification of race by economic function and geographical location. The Policy sought to achieve its objectives through rapid expansion of the economy over time and set its target of substantially reducing the incidence of absolute poverty by 1990. To achieve this, the Policy called for aggressive improvement of economic status and quality of life for all Malaysians. Concurrently, the Policy also called for fairer distribution of opportunities to participate in the widening range of economic activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80097221;Operation Cold Store was the code name for a covert security operation carried out in Singapore on 2 February 1963 which led to the arrest of 113 people, who were detained without trial under the Preservation of Public Service Security Ordinance (PSSO). In official accounts, the operation was a security operation "aimed at crippling the Communist open front organisation," which threatened Singapore's internal security. The operation was authorised by the Internal Security Council which was composed of representatives from the British, Singapore and Malayan Federal governments. The PAP was increasingly divided and these schisms became visible between 1960 and 1961. On 20 July 1961, left-wing members of the PAP defected from the PAP after Lee Kuan Yew's call for a motion of confidence in the government. Most of these members later formed the Barisan Sosialis (Barisan) on 30 July 1961, led by Lim Chin Siong. As many of the members who defected to the Barisan were prominent grassroots leaders, the Barisan had a strong support base and became a strong opposition party to the PAP. Given the Barisan's large support base, political onlookers speculated that the Barisan could potentially win the 1963 General Election. The British colonial records revealed that Lee Kuan Yew felt threatened by the powerful left-wing movements and had on several occasions tried to remove his opponents by invoking the PSSO to detain his opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80097222;The 1964 Singapore Riots refer to a series of communal race-based civil disturbances between the Malays and Chinese in Singapore following its merger with Malaysia in 1963, and were considered to be the "worst and most prolonged in Singapore's postwar history". The UMNO and the Malaysian Federal government blamed the Indonesian forces for stirring up potential conflict among the Malay Kampong regions. From the Malaysian government's point of view, Lee Kuan Yew and PAP were responsible for instigating these series of riots and discontent among the Malay community in Singapore. UMNO and Tun Razak had attributed to the Malay's anger and hostility towards the Chinese and Lee Kuan Yew's former speech made on 30 June 1964 for passing inflammatory remarks of the UMNO's communal politics. However, the American Embassy had refuted these claims by stating that Utusan Melayu could have misquoted Lee's speech. The racial riots subsided by 24 July 1964, as the number of communal clashes reported was reduced to seven cases. On 2 August, the imposition of the curfew since 21 July was completely lifted and the high police and military supervision removed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001900;Lee Kuan Yew was a Singaporean politician and lawyer who served as the first Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. As one of the founding members of the People's Action Party, Lee is recognised as the nation's founding father, credited with rapidly transitioning the country from a "developing third world country into a developed first world country within a single generation" under his leadership. Lee's rule was criticised for curtailing civil liberties (media control and limits on public protests) and bringing libel suits against political opponents. He argued that such disciplinary measures were necessary for political stability which, together with the rule of law, were essential for economic progress. Lee had once responded to critics of his style saying: "Anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle-dusters. If you think you can hurt me more than I can hurt you, try. There is no other way you can govern a Chinese society".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8002901;The Brunei revolt was a December 1962 insurrection in the British protectorate of Brunei by opponents of its monarchy and its proposed inclusion in the Federation of Malaysia. The insurgents were members of the TNKU (North Kalimantan National Army), a militia supplied by Indonesia and linked to the leftwing Brunei People's Party (BPP), which favoured a North Borneo Federation. The TNKU began co-ordinated attacks on the oil town of Seria (targeting the Royal Dutch Shell oil installations), on police stations, and on government facilities around the protectorate. The revolt began to break down within hours, having failed to achieve key objectives such as the capture of Brunei town and Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III. The revolt influenced the Sultan's 1963 decision not to join Malaysia. It is seen as one of the first stages of the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009703;In Malaya, between 1955 and 1956, UMNO, the MCA and the British hammered out a constitutional settlement for a principle of equal citizenship for all races. In exchange, the MCA agreed that Malaya's head of state would be drawn from the ranks of the Malay Sultans, that Malay would be the official language, and that Malay education and economic development would be promoted and subsidised. In effect, this meant that Malaya would be run by the Malays, particularly since they continued to dominate the civil service, the army and the police, but that the Chinese and Indians would have proportionate representation in the Cabinet and the parliament, would run those states where they were the majority, and would have their economic position protected. The difficult issue of who would control the education system was deferred until after independence. This came on 31 August 1957, when Tunku Abdul Rahman became the first Prime Minister of independent Malaya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009719;From 1946 to 1948, the eleven states formed a single British crown colony known as the Malayan Union. Due to opposition from Malay nationalists, the Union was disbanded and replaced by the Federation of Malaya, which restored the symbolic positions of the rulers of the Malay states. The Federation of Malaya Agreement was formulated by the British-Malay Pleno Conference between June and December 1946. At the end of the meeting, the Pleno Conference produced a 100-page "Blue Book." It was signed on 21 January 1948 at King House by the Malay rulers, and by Sir Edward Gent as the representative of the British government. The Agreement superseded the Agreement creating the Malayan Union, and prepared for the establishment of the Federation of Malaya on 1 February 1948. The position of the Malay rulers was also restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009723;The Singapore state government and the Malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economics issues, leading to discontent that culminated in the 1964 race riots in Singapore. The union was unstable due to distrust and ideological differences between the leaders of Singapore and of the federal government of Malaysia. After much heated ideological conflicts between the two governments, on 9 August 1965, the Malaysian Parliament voted 126 to 0 to expel Singapore from Malaysia with Singaporean delegates not present. These culminated in the decision by Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman to expel Singapore from the Federation, and on 9 August 1965, Singapore became the first and only modern country to date to gain independence unwillingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009728;The 13 May 1969 incident was the Sino-Malay sectarian violence that took place in Kuala Lumpur (then part of the state of Selangor), Malaysia on that date in 1969. The riot occurred in the aftermath of the 1969 Malaysian general election when opposition parties made gains at the expense of the ruling coalition, the Alliance Party. Official reports put the number of deaths due to the riots at 196, although Western diplomatic sources at the time suggested a toll of close to 600, with most of the victims Chinese. The racial riots led to a declaration of a state of national emergency or Darurat by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong resulting in the suspension of the Parliament by the Malaysian government, while the National Operations Council (NOC), also known as the Majlis Gerakan Negara (MAGERAN), was established as a caretaker government to temporarily govern the country between 1969 and 1971. In an attempt to form a broader coalition, the Barisan Nasional was formed in place of the Alliance Party, with former opposition parties such as Gerakan, PPP, and PAS invited to join the coalition. After the 1969 riot, UMNO also began to restructure the political system to reinforce its power along the principle of Ketuanan Melayu which galvanised Malay support for the party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001960;Francois Tombalbaye ruled the country during its independence on August 11, 1960, and was appointed its first head of government. Tombalbaye managed to create a coalition of progressive forces from both the north and south of the country and isolating the more conservative Islamic factions in the center as a colonial legislator. After independence, he adopted an autocratic form of government, eliminated opposition both within his party and outside his party by banning all other political parties. In 1963 Tombalbaye dissolved the National Assembly in response to rioting. He began nationalizing the civil service, replacing French administrators with less competent locals. He imposed a "National Loan", greatly increasing taxing, to fund the nationalisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001961;In order to maintain power, Tombalbaye heavily relied on French support. The Chadian Armed Forces were formed by Chadian veterans of the French military, and continued to receive training and equipment from France. In fact, France maintained a significant military presence in the country, and the nascent Chadian Air Force's first pilots were French. By 1968, Tombalbaye's military forces consisted of the 1,200-strong Chadian Armed Forces, the 700-strong Gendarmerie, the National and Nomadic Guard, and 120 French soldiers. This resentment at last exploded in Mangalme riots, a tax revolt on November 1, 1965, in the Guera Prefecture, causing 500 deaths. The year after saw the birth in Sudan of the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT), created to militarily oust Tombalbaye and the Southern dominance. It was the start of a bloody civil war. Tombalbaye then, to try and pacify the people, granted limited autonomy to northern Muslim leaders and released several political prisoners. These changes only added more leaders and rebels to the growing movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001962;The 1975 Chadian coup d'etat was in considerable part generated by the growing distrust of the President of Chad, Francois Tombalbaye, for the army. This distrust came in part from the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT) incapacity to deal with the rebellion that was inflaming the Muslim north from when the rebel insurgent group FROLINAT had been formed in 1966. The coup started before sunrise on April 13 when in Boraho, a locality 35 miles from the capital, army units led by Lieutenant Dimtolaum left their base and moved towards N'Djamena, where they converged on the President's white-walled palace on the edge of the city. At 5:00 a furious and bloody battle started with Tombalbaye's presidential guard, the Compagnies Tchadiennes de Securite (CTS). Decisive in deciding the outcome of the battle was the arrival of the interim commander of the FAT, Noel Milarew Odingar, who brought reinforcements and assumed command of the insurgents. At 8:30 Colonel Selebiani, head of the CTS, issued an appeal on the radio for his men to surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001963;Deby moved to Sudan and formed the Patriotic Salvation Movement, an insurgent group, supported by Libya and Sudan, which started operations against Habre in October 1989. He unleashed a decisive attack on 10 November 1990, and on 2 December Deby's troops marched unopposed into the capital, N'Djamena. Idriss Deby assumed Chad's presidency in 1990, and has been re-elected with a majority of votes every five years. After three months of provisional government, on 28 February 1991, a charter was approved for Chad with Deby as president. Deby, in the mid-1990s, gradually restored basic functions of government and entered into agreements with the World Bank and IMF to carry out substantial economic reforms. A new constitution was approved by referendum in March 1996, followed by a presidential election in June. Deby placed on the first round but fell short of a majority, he was then elected president in the second round, held in July, with 69% of the vote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001964;in 1996 Idriss Deby, a northerner, was confirmed president in Chad's first democratic election. In 1998 an armed rebellion began in the north, led by President Deby's former defence chief, Youssouf Togoimi. A Libyan peace deal in 2002 failed to put an end to the fighting. In 2003, conflict in the neighbouring Darfur region in Sudan leaked across the border into Chad. Refugees from Sudan were joined by Chadian civilians who were trying to escape rebel violence and eventually filled the camps. It was clear that Chad's rebels received weapons and assistance from the government of Sudan. At the same time, Sudan's rebels got help from Chad's government. In February 2008, three rebel groups joined forces and launched an attack on Chad's capital, N'Djamena. After launching an assault that failed to seize the presidential palace, the attack was decisively repulsed. France sent in troops to shore up the government. Many of the rebels were former allies of President Idriss Deby. They accused him of corruption towards members of his own tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

great_man_made_river_desc;The Great Man-Made River is a network of pipes that supplies fresh water obtained from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System fossil aquifer across Libya. It is the world's largest irrigation project. The project utilises a pipeline system that pumps water from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System from down south in Libya to cities in the populous Libyan northern Mediterranean coast including Tripoli and Benghazi. The water covers a distance of up to 1,600 kilometers and provides 70% of all freshwater used in Libya. According to its website, it is the largest underground network of pipes (2,820 kilometres) and aqueducts in the world. It consists of more than 1,300 wells, most more than 500 m deep, and supplies 6,500,000 m3 of fresh water per day to the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte and elsewhere. The late Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi described it as the "Eighth Wonder of the World".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022729;Three Croatian linguists, Stjepan Babi?, Bozidar Finka and Milan Mogush, published a spelling and grammar textbook in September 1971 called Hrvatski pravopis (Croatian Orthography), rather than the Srpskohrvatski (Serbo-Croatian). It was summarily banned, and virtually all copies were destroyed. However, a surviving copy found its way to London where it was reprinted and published in 1972. The Yugoslav leadership interpreted the whole affair as a restoration of Croatian nationalism, dismissed the movement as chauvinistic and had the police brutally suppress the demonstrators. Two thousand people were criminally prosecuted in Croatia in 1972 and 1973 for participation in these events. In 1972, more than 25,000 people were expelled from the League of Communists of Croatia. The social and political conservative forces engaged in a repression that prevented the final reforms that would have made Yugoslavia a true federation of sovereign republics and provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022728;Between 1945-1966, Rankovi? upheld Serbian minority control of mainly Albanian inhabited Kosovo through repressive anti-Albanian policies by the secret police. In Kosovo, the period 1947-1966 is colloquially known as "the Rankovi? era". During this time Kosovo became a police state under Rankovi? and his secret police force. Opposition grew to his rigid policies on Kosovo and also for policies undertaken in Croatia and Slovenia. Over time, evidence against Rankovi? was collected by his opponents. The situation ended in July 1966 with the removal of Rankovi? and his associates from their positions. Rankovi? was dismissed from the communist party (SKJ) and prohibited from participating in public functions. Yugoslav authorities stopped short of criminally prosecuting Rankovi? through a trial. The events around the dismissal of Rankovi? were depicted by the communist government as case of "Greater Serbian hegemony".;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was not recognized internationally. The name Krajina ("Frontier") was adopted from the historical Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy and Austria-Hungary, which had a substantial Serb population and existed up to the late 19th century. The RSK government waged a war for ethnic Serb independence from Croatia and unification with FR Yugoslavia and Republika Srpska (in Bosnia and Herzegovina).;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It claimed to be a sovereign state, though this claim was not recognised by the Bosnian government (whose territory the RS was recognized as nominally being a part of), the United Nations, or any other recognised state. After 1995, the RS is recognized as one of the two political entities composing Bosnia and Herzegovina. The borders of the post-1995 RS are, with a few negotiated modifications, based on the front lines and situation on the ground at the time of the Dayton Agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Croatian Community of Bosnian Posavina, proclaimed in northern Bosnia on 12 November 1991, was joined with Herzeg-Bosnia in October 1992. In its proclaimed borders, Herzeg-Bosnia encompassed about 30% of the country, but did not have effective control over the entire territory as parts of it were lost to the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) at the beginning of the Bosnian War. The armed forces of Herzeg-Bosnia, the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), were formed on 8 April 1992 and initially fought in an alliance with the Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims). Their relations deteriorated throughout late 1992, which led to the Croat-Bosniak War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8022741;In January 1990, the extraordinary 14th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was convened. The combined Yugoslav ruling party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ), was in crisis. Most of the Congress was spent with the Serbian and Slovene delegations arguing over the future of the League of Communists and Yugoslavia. SR Croatia prevented Serb protesters from reaching Slovenia. The Serbian delegation, led by Miloshevi?, insisted on a policy of "one person, one vote" in the party membership, which would empower the largest party ethnic group, the Serbs. In turn, the Croats and Slovenes sought to reform Yugoslavia by delegating even more power to six republics, but were voted down continuously in every motion and attempt to force the party to adopt the new voting system. As a result, the Croatian delegation, led by Chairman Ivica Ra?an, and Slovene delegation left the Congress on 23 January 1990, effectively dissolving the all-Yugoslav party. Along with external pressure, this caused the adoption of multi-party systems in all the republics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80227491;The Kumanovo Agreement, signed between the International Security Force (KFOR) and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia, was an accord concluded on 9 June 1999 in Kumanovo, current North Macedonia. It resulted in the end of the Kosovo War, and established new basic relations between FR Yugoslavia, and Kosovo Force, which would act to replace units of the Yugoslav Army, in Kosovo. On 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorised Kosovo Force (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022744;The Croat-Bosniak War was a conflict between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the self-proclaimed Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, supported by Croatia, that lasted from 18 October 1992 to 23 February 1994. It is often referred to as a "war within a war" because it was part of the larger Bosnian War. In the beginning, Bosniaks and Croats fought in an alliance against the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). By the end of 1992, however, tensions between Bosniaks and Croats increased. The first armed incidents between them occurred in October 1992 in central Bosnia. Their military alliance held out until early 1993 when their cooperation fell apart and the two former allies engaged in open conflict. The Croat-Bosniak War escalated in central Bosnia and soon spread to Herzegovina, with most of the fighting taking place in those two regions. The Bosniaks were organized in the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), and Croats in the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). The war generally consisted of sporadic conflicts with numerous ceasefires signed in the course of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022745;The Washington Agreement was a ceasefire agreement between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, signed in Washington on 18 March 1994 and Vienna. It was signed by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzi?, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Grani? and President of Herzeg-Bosnia Kreshimir Zubak. Under the agreement, the combined territory held by the Croat and Bosnian government forces was divided into ten autonomous cantons, establishing the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The cantonal system was selected to prevent dominance by one ethnic group over another. The subsequently signed Washington Framework Agreement had the creation of a loose federation (or confederation) between Croatia and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as one of its goals. In 1995, Bosnian government forces and Bosnian Croat forces of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina defeated forces of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, and this territory was added to the federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022747;The Srebrenica massacre was the July 1995 genocide of more than 8,000 Bosniaks, mainly men and boys, in and around the town of Srebrenica during the Bosnian War. The killings were perpetrated by units of the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of Ratko Mladi?. The Scorpions, a paramilitary unit from Serbia, who had been part of the Serbian Interior Ministry until 1991, also participated in the massacre. In April 1993 the United Nations (UN) had declared the besieged enclave of Srebrenica-in the Drina Valley of northeastern Bosnia-a "safe area" under UN protection. However, the UN failed to both demilitarise the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) within Srebrenica and force the withdrawal of the VRS surrounding Srebrenica. UNPROFOR's 370 Dutchbat soldiers in Srebrenica did not prevent the town's capture by the VRS-nor the subsequent massacre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022748;The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, also known as the Dayton Agreement, is the peace agreement reached at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, United States, on 1 November 1995, and formally signed in Paris, on 14 December 1995. These accords put an end to the ?3.5 year-long Bosnian War, one of the Yugoslav Wars. The warring parties agreed to peace and to a single sovereign state known as Bosnia and Herzegovina composed of two parts, the largely Serb-populated Republika Srpska and the Croat-Bosniak Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The State of Bosnia Herzegovina was set as of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and of the Republika Srpska. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complete state, as opposed to a confederation, no entity or entities could ever be separated from Bosnia and Herzegovina unless by due legal process. Although highly decentralised in its entities, it would still retain a central government, with a rotating State Presidency, a central bank and a constitutional court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022754;In 2003, after the constitutional changes and creation of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, a new President of Serbia and Montenegro was elected. He was also president of the Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro. Svetozar Marovi? was the first and last President of Serbia and Montenegro until its breakup in 2006. After the federation was reconstituted as a State Union, the new Assembly of the State Union was created. It was unicameral and was made up of 126 deputies, of which 91 were from Serbia and 35 were from Montenegro. The Assembly convened in the building of the old Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia, which now houses the National Assembly of Serbia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022743;In early 1992, a conflict engulfed Bosnia and Herzegovina as it also declared independence from rump Yugoslavia. The war was predominantly a territorial conflict between the Bosniaks, who wanted to preserve the territorial integrity of the newly independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb proto-state Republika Srpska and the self-proclaimed Herzeg-Bosnia, which were led and supplied by Serbia and Croatia respectively, reportedly with a goal of the partition of Bosnia, which would leave only a small part of land for the Bosniaks. On 18 December 1992, the UN General Assembly issued resolution 47/121 in which it condemned Serbian and Montenegrin forces for trying to acquire more territories by force. The Yugoslav armed forces had disintegrated into a largely Serb-dominated military force. The JNA opposed the Bosnian-majority led government's agenda for independence, and along with other armed nationalist Serb militant forces attempted to prevent Bosnian citizens from voting in the 1992 referendum on independence. They failed to persuade people not to vote, and instead the intimidating atmosphere combined with a Serb boycott of the vote resulted in a resounding 99% vote in support for independence. On 19 June 1992, the war in Bosnia broke out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022708;Tito became increasingly ill over the course of 1979. During this time Vila Srna was built for his use near Morovi? in the event of his recovery. On 7 January and again on 11 January 1980, Tito was admitted to the Medical Centre in Ljubljana, the capital city of the SR Slovenia, with circulation problems in his legs. Tito's own stubbornness and refusal to allow doctors to follow through with the necessary amputation of his left leg played a part in his eventual death of gangrene-induced infection. His Adjutant later testified that Tito threatened to take his own life if his leg was ever to be amputated, and that he had to actually hide Tito's pistol in fear that he would follow through on his threats. After a private conversation with his two sons Zarko and Misho Broz, he finally agreed, and his left leg was amputated due to arterial blockages. The amputation proved to be too late, and Tito died at the Medical Centre of Ljubljana on 4 May 1980, three days short of his 88th birthday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022727;Tito did not even attend the second meeting of the Cominform, fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. On 28 June, the other member countries expelled Yugoslavia, citing "nationalist elements" that had "managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership" of the CPY. The resolution warned Yugoslavia that it was on the path back to bourgeois capitalism due to its nationalist, independence-minded positions. The expulsion effectively banished Yugoslavia from the international association of socialist states. After the expulsion, Tito suppressed those who supported the resolution, calling them "Cominformists". Many were sent to a gulag-like prison camp at Goli otok ("Barren Island"). Between 1948 and 1952, the Soviet Union encouraged its allies to rebuild their military forces-especially Hungary, which was to be the leading force in a possible war against Yugoslavia. Titoism was denounced by Moscow as a heresy that said communist countries should take a nationalist road to socialism different from that of the Soviet Union. Across Eastern Europe, communist leaders suspected of Tito-like tendencies were purged by pro-Moscow elements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022740;The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution was the fourth and final constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It came into effect on 21 February 1974. Although the new constitution dealt with the codification of the socio-economic system towards the achievements of the theory of self-management socialism to a greater extent, the most controversial and historical consequences arose from the regulations of the Constitution about the state organisation of Yugoslavia, which were later used as the legal basis for the breakup of Yugoslavia and differently interpreted by the warring parties during the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The new Constitution also reduced the State Presidency from twenty-three to nine members, with equal representation for each republic and province and an ex-officio position for the president of the League of Communists. The constitution also proclaimed Josip Broz Tito president for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022742;The Ten-Day War was a brief conflict that followed Slovenia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. It was fought between the Slovenian Territorial Defence and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). It lasted from 27 June 1991 until 7 July 1991, when the Brioni Accords were signed, allowing Slovenia to gain independence without a large scale war. It marked the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars, although Slovenia had successfully achieved full independence, JNA units were now solely fighting in Croatia. Initially, the federal government ordered the Yugoslav People's Army to secure border crossings in Slovenia. Slovenian police and Slovenian Territorial Defence blockaded barracks and roads, leading to stand-offs and limited skirmishes around the republic. After several dozen casualties, the limited conflict was stopped through negotiation at Brioni on 7 July 1991, when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a three-month moratorium on secession. The Federal army completely withdrew from Slovenia by 26 October 1991.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80227421;The Brioni Agreement is a document signed by representatives of Slovenia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia under the political sponsorship of the European Community (EC) on the Brijuni Islands on 7 July 1991. The agreement sought to create an environment in which further negotiations on the future of Yugoslavia could take place. However, ultimately it isolated the federal prime minister Ante Markovi? in his efforts to preserve Yugoslavia, and effectively stopped any form of federal influence over Slovenia. This meant the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) would focus on combat in Croatia, creating a precedent of redrawing international borders and staking the EC's interest in resolving the Yugoslav crisis. The agreement put an end to hostilities between the Yugoslav and Slovene forces in the Ten-Day War. Slovenia and Croatia agreed to suspend activities stemming from their 25 June declarations of independence for a period of three months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80227422;A majority of Croats wanted Croatia to leave Yugoslavia and become a sovereign country, while many ethnic Serbs living in Croatia, supported by Serbia, opposed the secession and wanted Serb-claimed lands to be in a common state with Serbia. Most Serbs sought a new Serb state within a Yugoslav federation, including areas of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina with ethnic Serb majorities or significant minorities, and attempted to conquer as much of Croatia as possible. Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991, but agreed to postpone it with the Brioni Agreement and cut all remaining ties with Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991. The JNA initially tried to keep Croatia within Yugoslavia by occupying all of Croatia. After this failed, Serb forces established the self-proclaimed proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) within Croatia. After the ceasefire of January 1992 and international recognition of the Republic of Croatia as a sovereign state, the front lines were entrenched, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed, and combat became largely intermittent in the following three years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80227423;The Vance Plan was designed to implement a ceasefire, demilitarise parts of Croatia that were under the control of Croatian Serbs and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), allow the return of refugees, and create favourable conditions for negotiations on a permanent political settlement of the conflict resulting from the breakup of Yugoslavia. The first agreement, known as the Geneva Accord, was signed by Yugoslav defence minister General Veljko Kadijevi?, President of Serbia Slobodan Miloshevi? and Croatian President Franjo Tu?man in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. Because the ceasefire agreed at that time did not hold, further negotiations resulted in the Implementation Agreement of 2 January 1992. The Implementation Agreement, signed in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, by JNA Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija Rasheta and Croatian defence minister Gojko Shushak, produced a longer-lasting ceasefire, which was supervised by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The parties failed to completely implement the remaining major aspects of the Vance plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80227424;The Republic of Serbian Krajina was a self-proclaimed Serb proto-state, a territory within the newly independent Croatia (formerly part of Yugoslavia), which it defied, and which was active during the Croatian War (1991-95). It was not recognised internationally. Its main portion was overrun by Croatian forces in 1995 and the Republic of Serbian Krajina was ultimately disbanded as a result, a rump remained in eastern Slavonia under UNTAES administration until its peaceful reintegration into Croatia in 1998 per Erdut Agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80227425;The Erdut Agreement, officially the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, was an agreement reached on 12 November 1995 between the authorities of the Republic of Croatia and the local Serb authorities of the Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia region on the peaceful resolution to the Croatian War of Independence in eastern Croatia. It initiated process of peaceful reintegration of the region to the central government control (implemented by the United Nations) and provided set of guarantees on minority rights and refugee return. It was named after Erdut, the village in which it was signed. The agreement was acknowledged by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1023, and it paved the way to the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium. UNTAES was not designed as an ordinary UN mission but rather as an transitional administration, partially modeled on the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, therefore providing the UNTAES with direct and supreme governing mandate over the region which was an effective United Nations protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022749;The Kosovo War was an armed conflict in Kosovo that started in late February 1998 and lasted until 11 June 1999. It was fought by the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (i.e. Serbia and Montenegro), which controlled Kosovo before the war, and the Kosovo Albanian rebel group known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), with air support from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) from 24 March 1999, and ground support from the Albanian army. After attempts at a diplomatic solution failed, NATO intervened, justifying the campaign in Kosovo as a "humanitarian war". This precipitated a mass expulsion of Kosovar Albanians as the Yugoslav forces continued to fight during the aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia (March-June 1999). The war ended with the Kumanovo Treaty, with Yugoslav and Serb forces agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo to make way for an international presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022751;In September 1991, the Republic of Macedonia also declared independence, becoming the only former republic to gain sovereignty without resistance from the Belgrade-based Yugoslav authorities. 500 US soldiers were then deployed under the UN banner to monitor Macedonia's northern borders with the Republic of Serbia. Macedonia's first president, Kiro Gligorov, maintained good relations with Belgrade and the other breakaway republics and there have to date been no problems between Macedonian and Serbian border police even though small pockets of Kosovo and the Preshevo valley complete the northern reaches of the historical region known as Macedonia (Prohor P?injski part), which would otherwise create a border dispute if ever Macedonian nationalism should resurface (see VMRO). This was despite the fact that the Yugoslav Army refused to abandon its military infrastructure on the top of the Straza Mountain up to the year 2000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8022753;After the collapse of SFR Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the two Serb majority republics, Serbia and Montenegro, agreed to remain as Yugoslavia, and established a new Constitution in 1992, which established the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as essential rump state, comprising only of Serbs. As Communism had collapsed in the Eastern Bloc, the new state also abandoned its Communist legacy: the Red Star was removed from the national flag, and the Communist Coat of Arms was replaced by a new Coat of Arms representing Serbia and Montenegro. The new state also established the office of the president, held by a single person, initially appointed with the consent of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro until 1997 after which the president was democratically elected. The President of Yugoslavia acted alongside the Presidents of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8000326;The Algiers putsch, also known as the Generals' putsch, was a failed coup d'etat intended to force French President Charles de Gaulle not to abandon French Algeria, along with the resident European community and pro-French Muslims. Organised in French Algeria by retired French Army generals Maurice Challe, Edmond Jouhaud, Andre Zeller and Raoul Salan, it took place from the afternoon of 21 April to 26 April 1961 in the midst of the Algerian War (1954-62). The organisers of the putsch were opposed to the secret negotiations that French Prime Minister Michel Debre's government had started with the anti-colonialist National Liberation Front (FLN). Gen. Raoul Salan stated that he joined the coup without concerning himself with its technical planning;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8005731;The trigger for the collapse of the Fourth French Republic was the Algiers crisis of 1958. Charles de Gaulle, who had retired from politics a decade before, placed himself in the midst of the crisis, calling on the nation to suspend the government and create a new constitutional system. De Gaulle was carried to power by the inability of the parliament to choose a government, popular protest, and the last parliament of the Fourth Republic voting for their dissolution and the convening of a constitutional convention. The Fourth Republic suffered from a lack of political consensus, a weak executive, and governments forming and falling in quick succession since 1946. With no party or coalition able to sustain a parliamentary majority, prime ministers found themselves unable to risk their political position with unpopular reforms. De Gaulle and his supporters proposed a system of strong presidents elected for seven-year terms. The president, under the proposed constitution, would have executive powers to run the country in consultation with a prime minister whom he would appoint. These plans were approved by more than 80% of those who voted in the referendum of 28 September 1958. The new constitution was signed into law on 4 October 1958. Since each new constitution established a new republic, France moved from the Fourth to the Fifth Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610124;In late 1955, in the middle of what came to be known as the Revolution of the King and the People, Sultan Mohammed V successfully negotiated the gradual restoration of Moroccan independence within a framework of French-Moroccan interdependence. The sultan agreed to institute reforms that would transform Morocco into a constitutional monarchy with a democratic form of government. In February 1956, Morocco acquired limited home rule. Further negotiations for full independence culminated in the French-Moroccan Agreement signed in Paris on 2 March 1956. On 7 April 1956, France officially relinquished its protectorate in Morocco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610125;On 20 March 1956 the Franco-Tunisian protocol was signed by the Grand Vizier Tahar Ben Ammar and the French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau. The new Tunisian government, led by Bourguiba, deemed the country to be independent by virtue of this protocol, and therefore refused to enter into the subsequent bilateral negotiations it provided for. Independence was regarded as a fait accompli, and for this reason the independence protocol was never ratified either by the Bey, or indeed by France, although this is what the protocol on internal autonomy required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1015800;The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act, is a United States federal law that restricts the activities and power of labor unions. It was enacted by the 80th United States Congress over the veto of President Harry S. Truman, becoming law on June 23, 1947. Taft-Hartley was introduced in the aftermath of a major strike wave in 1945 and 1946. The Taft-Hartley Act amended the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), prohibiting unions from engaging in several "unfair labor practices". Among the practices prohibited by the act are jurisdictional strikes, wildcat strikes, solidarity or political strikes, secondary boycotts, secondary and mass picketing, closed shops, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns. The NLRA also allowed states to pass right-to-work laws banning union shops. Enacted during the early stages of the Cold War, the law required union officers to sign non-communist affidavits with the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012689;KaNgwane was a bantustan in South Africa, intended by the apartheid government to be a semi-independent homeland for the Swazi people. It was called the "Swazi Territorial Authority" from 1976 to 1977. In September 1977 it was renamed KaNgwane and received a legislative assembly. An attempt to transfer parts of the homeland, along with parts of the Zulu homeland KwaZulu, to the neighbouring country of Swaziland in 1982 was never realised. This would have given land-locked Swaziland access to the sea. The deal was negotiated by the governments, but was met by popular opposition in the territory meant to be transferred. The homeland's territory had been claimed by King Sobhuza of Swaziland as part of the Swazi monarchs' traditional realm, and the South African government hoped to use the homeland as a buffer zone against guerrilla infiltration from Mozambique. South Africa responded to the failure of the transfer by temporarily suspending the autonomy of KaNgwane, then restoring it in December 1982 and granting it nominal self-rule in 1984.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610123;A delegation of senior party officials have met with the $MONARCHTITLE$ to express their dissastisfaction with the current trend of democratisation in $COUNTRY$. These party hardliners have significant vested interests in the preservation of the authoritarian status quo and view any step towards democratisation as an existential threat to their class. Although the $MONARCHTITLE$ still has unfettered power over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government, he should do well to avoid ignoring the demands of this influential group of party members for it can lead to an eventual coup d'etat. We can avoid this event by keeping the non-liberal officer pops below 5 militancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610122;Libya is a country in the Maghreb region in North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad to the south, Niger to the southwest, Algeria to the west, and Tunisia to the northwest. The sovereign state is made of three historical regions: Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost 1.8 million square kilometres, Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world. The largest city and capital, Tripoli, is located in western Libya and contains over one million of Libya's six million people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500301;In 1955, Nasser was claiming to be the leader of Arab nationalism, in opposition to the traditional monarchies, especially the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq following its signing of the 1955 Baghdad Pact. At that time the U.S. feared that communism would spread to the Middle East, and it saw Nasser as a natural leader of an anticommunist procapitalist Arab League. America and the United Kingdom offered to help finance construction of the High Dam, with a loan of 270 million, in return for Nasser's leadership in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. While opposed to communism, capitalism, and imperialism, Nasser identified as a tactical neutralist, and sought to work with both the U.S. and the USSR for Egyptian and Arab benefit. After the UN criticised a raid by Israel against Egyptian forces in Gaza in 1955, Nasser realized that he could not portray himself as the leader of pan-Arab nationalism if he could not defend his country militarily against Israel. In addition to his development plans, he looked to quickly modernise his military, and he turned first to the U.S. for aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500302;On 16 May 1956, Nasser officially recognised the People's Republic of China, which angered the U.S. and Secretary Dulles, a sponsor of the Republic of China. This move, coupled with the impression that the project was beyond Egypt's economic capabilities, caused Eisenhower to withdraw all American financial aid for the Aswan Dam project on 19 July. The Eisenhower administration believed that if Nasser were able to secure Soviet economic support for the high dam, that would be beyond the capacity of the Soviet Union to support, and in turn would strain Soviet-Egyptian relations. Several other factors contributed to the US deciding to withdraw its offer of funding for the dam. Dulles believed that the USSR would not fulfil its commitment of military aid. He was also irritated by Nasser's neutrality and attempts to play both sides of the Cold War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He was also irritated by Nasser's neutrality and attempts to play both sides of the Cold War. Nasser's response was the nationalisation of the Suez Canal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500305;On 26 July, in a speech in Alexandria, Nasser gave a riposte to Dulles. During his speech he deliberately pronounced the name of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the canal, a code-word for Egyptian forces to seize control of the canal and implement its nationalisation. He announced that the Nationalization Law had been published, that all assets of the Suez Canal Company had been frozen, and that stockholders would be paid the price of their shares according to the day's closing price on the Paris Stock Exchange. That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. The nationalisation surprised Britain and its Commonwealth. There had been no discussion of the canal at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London in late June and early July. Egypt's action, however, threatened British economic and military interests in the region. Prime Minister Eden was under immense domestic pressure from Conservative MPs who drew direct comparisons between the events of 1956 and those of the Munich Agreement in 1938. Since the U.S. government did not support the British protests, the British government decided in favour of military intervention against Egypt to avoid the complete collapse of British prestige in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. On 29 July 1956, the French Cabinet decided upon military action against Egypt in alliance with Israel, and Admiral Nomy of the French Naval General Staff was sent to Britain to inform the leaders of that country of France's decision, and to invite them to co-operate if interested. At the same time, Mollet felt very much offended by what he considered to be the lackadaisical attitude of the Eisenhower administration to the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company. This was especially the case because earlier in 1956 the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had offered the French a deal whereby if Moscow ended its support of the FLN in Algeria, Paris would pull out of NATO and became neutral in the Cold War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. Israel wanted to reopen the Straits of Tiran leading to the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping, and saw the opportunity to strengthen its southern border and to weaken what it saw as a dangerous and hostile state. This was particularly felt in the form of attacks injuring approximately 1,300 civilians emanating from the Egyptian-held Gaza Strip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500309;On 30 October, the Security Council held a meeting, at the request of the United States, when it submitted a draft resolution calling upon Israel immediately to withdraw its armed forces behind the established armistice lines. It was not adopted because of British and French vetoes. A similar draft resolution sponsored by the Soviet Union was also rejected. On 31 October, also as planned, France and the UK launched an air attack against targets in Egypt, which was followed shortly by a landing of their troops at the northern end of the canal zone. Later that day, considering the grave situation created by the actions against Egypt, and with lack of unanimity among the permanent members preventing it from exercising its primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security, the Security Council passed Resolution 119. It decided to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly for the first time, as provided in the 1950 "Uniting for Peace" resolution, in order to make appropriate recommendations to end the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The emergency special session was convened on 1st November, the same day Nasser requested diplomatic assistance from the U.S., without requesting the same from the Soviet Union, he was at first sceptical of the efficacy of US diplomatic efforts at the UN, but later gave full credit to Eisenhower's role in stopping the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8500310;Although the Soviet Union's position in the crisis was as helpless as was the United States' regarding Hungary's uprising, Premier Nikolai Bulganin threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side, and to launch rocket attacks on Britain, France and Israel. Bulganin accused Ben-Gurion of supporting European colonialism, and Mollet of hypocrisy for leading a socialist government while pursuing a right-wing foreign policy. He did however concede in his letter to Eden that Britain had legitimate interests in Egypt. The Soviet threat to send troops to Egypt to fight the Allies led Eisenhower to fear that this might be the beginning of World War III. One of Eisenhower's aides Emmet Hughes recalled that the reaction at the White House to the Bulganin letters was "sombre" as there was fear that this was the beginning to the countdown to World War III, a war that if it occurred would kill hundreds of millions of people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8012218;The Rhodesian Bush War was a civil conflict from July 1964 to December 1979 in the unrecognised country of Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe-Rhodesia). The conflict pitted three forces against one another: the Rhodesian white minority-led government of Ian Smith (later the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa) the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, the military wing of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union. The war and its subsequent Internal Settlement, signed in 1978 by Smith and Muzorewa, led to the implementation of universal suffrage in June 1979 and the end of white minority rule in Rhodesia, which was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia under a black majority government. However, this new order failed to win international recognition and the war continued. Neither side achieved a military victory and a compromise was later reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012215;The Lancaster House Agreement, signed on 21 December 1979, declared a ceasefire, ending the Rhodesian Bush War and directly led to the creation and recognition of the Republic of Zimbabwe. It required the imposition of direct British rule, nullifying Rhodesia's 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence. British governance would be strictly proscribed to the duration of a proposed election period after which independence would follow. The Agreement would lead to the dissolution of the unrecognised state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia, created months earlier by the Internal Settlement: an agreement forged between moderate black nationalists and Prime Minister Ian Smith's Government. While Zimbabwe-Rhodesia remained unrecognised, the Internal Settlement enfranchised the majority of blacks (hitherto the key British demand) and resulted in the election of the country's first black Prime Minister.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8000608;The Angolan Civil War was a civil war in Angola, beginning in 1975 and continuing, with interludes, until 2002. The war began immediately after Angola became independent from Portugal in November 1975. The war was a power struggle between two former anti-colonial guerrilla movements, the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The war was used as a surrogate battleground for the Cold War by rival states such as the Soviet Union, Cuba, South Africa and the United States. The MPLA and UNITA had different roots in Angolan society and mutually incompatible leaderships, despite their shared aim of ending colonial rule. A third movement, the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), having fought the MPLA with UNITA during the war for independence, played almost no role in the Civil War. Additionally, the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC), an association of separatist militant groups, fought for the independence of the province of Cabinda from Angola.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80126122;The South African Border War, also known as the Namibian War of Independence, and sometimes denoted in South Africa as the Angolan Bush War, was a largely asymmetric conflict that occurred in Namibia (then South West Africa), Zambia, and Angola from 26 August 1966 to 21 March 1990. It was fought between the South African Defence Force (SADF) and the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), an armed wing of the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO). The South African Border War resulted in some of the largest battles on the African continent since World War II and was closely intertwined with the Angolan Civil War. Despite being largely fought in neighbouring states, the South African Border War had a phenomenal cultural and political impact on South African society. The country's apartheid government devoted considerable effort towards presenting the war as part of a containment programme against regional Soviet expansionism and used it to stoke public anti-communist sentiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80126121;The Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith was a statement of core principles laid down by South African political leaders Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz on 4 January 1974. It was signed in Mahlabatini, KwaZulu-Natal, hence its name. Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi-racial society, stressing opportunity for all, consultation, the federal concept, and a Bill of Rights. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. It was the first agreement in apartheid South Africa by acknowledged black and white political leaders that subscribed to such principles. Final negotiations, which embodied many of the Declaration's principles, took place between President F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela in the early 1990s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012614;In his opening address to parliament, De Klerk unbanned the exiled liberation movements, notably the African National Congress (ANC), Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) and South African Communist Party (SACP). All had been embroiled in a fight against white minority rule. He also announced a moratorium on the death penalty, the end of the state of emergency - which had been in place for five years - and the release of political prisoners. The speech set off a series of dramatic, and, until that point, unforeseen events. Nine days later Nelson Mandela was released from prison after 27 years. Within three months the first bilateral talks between the ANC and the De Klerk government happened. The end of apartheid is coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012613;In 1983, Botha proposed a new constitution, which was then put to a vote of the white population. Though it did not implement a federal system as established in 1961, it implemented what was ostensibly a power-sharing agreement with Coloureds and Indians. The new constitution created two new houses of parliament alongside the existing, the white-only House of Assembly-the House of Representatives for Coloureds and the House of Delegates for Indians. The three chambers of the new Tricameral Parliament had sole jurisdiction over matters relating to their respective communities. Legislation affecting "general affairs," such as foreign policy and race relations, had to pass all three chambers after consideration by joint standing committees. The plan included no chamber or system of representation for the black majority. Each Black ethno-linguistic group was allocated a 'homeland' which would initially be a semi-autonomous area. However, blacks were legally considered citizens of the Bantustans, not of South Africa, and were expected to exercise their political rights there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012610;The Defiance Campaign against Unjust Laws was presented by the African National Congress (ANC) at a conference held in Bloemfontein, South Africa in December 1951. The Campaign had roots in events leading up the conference. The demonstrations, taking place in 1952 were the first "large-scale, multi-racial political mobilisation against apartheid laws under a common leadership". The South African government viewed the protests as acts of anarchy, communism and disorder. The Nationalist newspaper, the Oosterlig, wrote that the protesters "find prison a pleasant abode. As a result of the protests, the National Party started "imposing stiff penalties for protesting discriminatory laws" and then they created the Public Safety Act. The goals of the Defiance Campaign were not met, but the protests "demonstrated large-scale and growing opposition to apartheid".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012611;The Freedom Charter was the statement of core principles of the South African Congress Alliance, which consisted of the African National Congress (ANC) and its allies: the South African Indian Congress, the South African Congress of Democrats and the Coloured People's Congress. It is characterised by its opening demand, "The People Shall Govern!" The document signified a major break with the past traditions of the struggle, this was no longer a civil rights movement seeking to be accommodated in the existing structures of society, but called for a fundamental restructuring of all aspects of South African society. After the Congress was denounced as treason, the South African government banned the ANC and arrested 156 activists, including Mandela, who were put on trial in the 1956 Treason Trial, in which all were acquitted. The Charter continued to circulate in the revolutionary underground and inspired a new generation of young militants in the 1980s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012612;The Sharpeville massacre occurred on 21 March 1960, at the police station in the South African township of Sharpeville in Transvaal (today part of Gauteng). After a day of demonstrations against pass laws, a crowd of about 7,000 protesters went to the police station. The South African Police opened fire on the crowd, killing 69 people and injuring 180 others. Sources disagree as to the behaviour of the crowd, some state that the crowd was peaceful, while others state that the crowd had been hurling stones at the police, and that the shooting started when the crowd started advancing toward the fence around the police station. There were 249 casualties in total, including 29 children. Many were shot in the back as they fled. The uproar among South Africa's black population was immediate, and the following week saw demonstrations, protest marches, strikes, and riots around the country. On 30 March 1960, the government declared a state of emergency, detaining more than 18,000 people, including prominent anti-apartheid activists who were known as members of the Congress Alliance including Nelson Mandela and some still enmeshed in the Treason Trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012621;The parliamentary election in South Africa on 26 May 1948 represented a turning point in the country's history. The United Party, which had led the government since its foundation in 1933, and its leader, incumbent Prime Minister Jan Smuts, were ousted by the Reunited National Party (HNP), led by Daniel Francois Malan, a Dutch Reformed cleric. During the election battle, both the UP and the NP formed coalitions with smaller parties. The UP was aligned with the left-leaning Labour Party, while the Afrikaner Party sought to advance Afrikaner rights by allying with the HNP. By legislation relating to franchise requirements, very few people of Colored and Asian descent were able to vote in this election, Africans had been banned altogether since the late 1930s, with the limited number of Africans meeting electoral qualifications voting for seven "own" white MPs separately. The election marked the onset of 46 years of nationalist rule in South Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012625;In a referendum held on 17 March 1992, the white electorate voted 68% in favour of democracy. After lengthy negotiations under the auspices of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), a draft constitution was published on 26 July 1993, containing concessions towards all sides: a federal system of regional legislatures, equal voting-rights regardless of race, and a bicameral legislature. From 26-29 April 1994, the South African population voted in the first universal suffrage general elections. The African National Congress won, well ahead of the governing National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party. The Democratic Party and Pan Africanist Congress, among others, formed a parliamentary opposition in the country's first non-racial parliament. Nelson Mandela was elected as President on 9 May 1994 and formed a Government of National Unity, consisting of the ANC, the National Party and Inkatha. On 10 May 1994 Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's new President in Pretoria with Thabo Mbeki and F. W. De Klerk as his vice-presidents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80126221;A Bantustan was a territory that the white National Party administration of South Africa set aside for black inhabitants of South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia), as part of its policy of apartheid. The Government established ten Bantustans in South Africa, and ten in neighbouring South West Africa (then under South African administration), for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups, thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating autonomous nation states for South Africa's different black ethnic groups. Under the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970, the Government stripped black South Africans of their citizenship, which deprived them of their few remaining political and civil rights in South Africa, and declared them to be citizens of these homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80126222;Namibia became one of several flashpoints for Cold War proxy conflicts in southern Africa during the latter years of the PLAN insurgency. The insurgents sought out weapons and sent recruits to the Soviet Union for military training. SWAPO's political leadership, dependent on military aid from the Soviets, Cuba, and Angola, positioned the movement within the socialist bloc by 1975. This practical alliance reinforced the prevailing perspective of SWAPO as a Soviet proxy, which dominated Cold War ideology in South Africa and the United States. For its part, the Soviet Union supported SWAPO partly because it viewed South Africa as a regional Western ally. Growing war weariness and the reduction of tensions between the superpowers compelled South Africa, Angola, and Cuba to accede to the Tripartite Accord, under pressure from both the Soviet Union and the United States. South Africa accepted Namibian independence in exchange for Cuban military withdrawal from the region and an Angolan commitment to cease all aid to PLAN. PLAN and South Africa adopted an informal ceasefire in August 1988, and a United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) was formed to monitor the Namibian peace process and supervise the return of refugees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1610121;During the Sino-Portuguese Talks regarding the transfer of sovereignty of Macau, the People's Republic of China demanded that Portuguese Macau be immediately handed over to them or face possible war. $MONARCHTITLE$, what will be your response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8011707;When the government of the People's Republic of China obtained its seat in the United Nations as a result of the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971, it began to take diplomatic action to re-establish Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai was especially concerned with the issue. On 25 April 1974, a group of low-ranking Portuguese officers organised a coup d'etat, overthrowing the right-wing ruling government that had been in power for 48 years. The new government began the democratisation of Portugal and the decolonisation of its remaining overseas possession. The new Portuguese government promised the return of Macau to Chinese rule. Both Portugal and the People's Republic of China recognised Macau as Chinese territory under temporary Portuguese administration, and agreed that the exact time for its return and related details would be discussed later between the two sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80028321;On 20 May 1986, the People's Republic of China, along with Portugal, officially announced that talks on Macanese affairs would take place in Beijing on 30 June 1986. The Portuguese delegation arrived in Beijing in June, and was welcomed by the Chinese delegation led by Zhou Nan. During the negotiations, Portuguese representatives offered to return Macau in 1985, but Chinese representatives rejected that year (as well rejecting previous requests for 1967, 1975, and 1977). China requested 1997, the same year as Hong Kong, but Portugal refused. 2004 was suggested by Portugal, as well as 2007 as that year would mark the 450th anniversary of Portugal renting Macau. However, China insisted for a year before 2000 as the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in Hong Kong would be dissolved in 2000 as envisioned in 1986 (the Joint Liaison Group would be dissolved in 1999). Eventually the year 1999 was agreed upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the afternoon of 19 December 1999, the 127th Portuguese Governor of Macau Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira lowered the flags in Macau, which was the prelude of the ceremony for the establishment of the Macau Special Administrative Region. The official transfer of sovereignty was held at midnight on that day at the Cultural Centre of Macau Garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610117;In the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the People's Republic of China Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997 and the United Kingdom Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. In accordance with the "One country, two systems" principle agreed between the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, the socialist system of the People's Republic of China would not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years. This would leave Hong Kong unchanged until 2047. Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, introduced a package of electoral reforms in the Legislative Council. These reforms proposed to enlarge the electorate, thus making voting in the Legislative Council more democratic. This move posed significant changes because Hong Kong citizens would have the power to make decisions regarding their future. The handover ceremony was held at the new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on the night of 30 June 1997.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8009509;The Mexican miracle is a term used to refer to the country's inward-looking development strategy that produced sustained economic growth. It is considered to be a golden age of capitalism in Mexican economics in which the Mexican economy grew 4% each year. It was a stabilising economic plan which caused an average growth of 6.8% and industrial production to increase by 8% with inflation staying at only 2.5%. An important factor helping sustained growth in the period 1940-1970 was the reduction of political turmoil, particularly around national elections, with the creation of a single, dominant party. In the years following World War II, President Miguel Aleman Valdes (1946-52) instituted a full-scale import-substitution program which stimulated output by boosting internal demand. The government raised import controls on consumer goods but relaxed them on capital goods, which it purchased with international reserves accumulated during the war. The government spent it heavily on infrastructure, including major dam projects to produce hydroelectric power, supply drinking water to cities and irrigation water to agriculture, and control flooding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009510;The Mexican Dirty War refers to the Mexican theater of the Cold War, an internal conflict in the 1960s and 1970s between the Mexican PRI-ruled government under the presidencies of Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, Luis Echeverria and Jose Lopez Portillo, which were backed by the US government, and left-wing student and guerrilla groups. During the war, government forces carried out disappearances, estimated at 1,200, systematic torture, and "probable extrajudicial executions". The year 1960 marked the beginning of a decade of terror in the region of Guerrero as the state slowly began to deal with the citizens and peasants there ever-more violently. The state enacted the acts of suppression on Guerrero to keep the numerous different political reform movements stifled, as the local people over time grew agitated with the way the government was wielding its power and meddling with their rights. As the citizens grew more determined to speak out against the government in the 1960s, the PRI continued to increase its terror tactics in the region. While that was done to keep the populace under its control, the constant stream of violence pushed many guerrillas to consider raising up arms against the PRI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009511;Following a summer of increasingly large demonstrations in Mexico City protesting the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico City, the Mexican Armed Forces opened fire on October 2, 1968 on unarmed civilians, killing an undetermined number, in the hundreds. It occurred in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City. The events are considered part of the Mexican Dirty War, when the government used its forces to suppress political opposition. The massacre occurred 10 days before the Olympics' opening ceremony. The head of the Federal Directorate of Security reported that 1,345 people were arrested. At the time, the government and the media in Mexico claimed that government forces had been provoked by protesters shooting at them, but government documents made public since 2000 suggest that snipers had been employed by the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009512;After the petroleum boom previous to the government of Mexican president Jose Lopez Portillo (from 1976 to 1982), the Mexican government began to rely heavily on export barrels to support the financial needs in the country. These exports were mainly directed towards the United States, mainly due to the petroleum crisis of 1973, taking advantage of the high prices these barrels garnered. When the market finally settled, thus reducing the high prices per barrel, the financial stability of the country was endangered. Diversification of income would have prevented the problem, but due to the inability of other production sectors to make up for the reduced profit, Mexico had to inflate the currency to by then historic levels. The Mexican peso would then be devaluated by almost 500%. Given these circumstances, Lopez Portillo nationalised all financial institutions in 1982, during his last public address to the nation by saying: "Defendere el peso como un perro".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009513;In 1985 the Mexican government signaled a fundamental change in development strategy by reorienting economic policy toward trade liberalisation and export promotion. It expected renewed export promotion to restore external balance and trade liberalisation to restrain domestic prices by encouraging import competition. In July 1985, the government substantially reduced import licensing requirements and raised the share of total imports exempt from licensing. It compensated slightly for these measures by raising tariffs. The government also devalued the peso again, despite the inflationary consequences, to force previously protected domestic firms to become more competitive against imported goods. In late 1986, the government cautiously relaxed credit to the private sector in an effort to ease the economy out of recession. External financing was again made available in 1987 following approval of a debt rescheduling plan proposed by United States Secretary of the Treasury James A. Baker III.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009514;The 1985 Mexico City earthquake struck in the early morning of 19 September at 07:17:50 (CST) with a moment magnitude of 8.0 and a maximal Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The event caused serious damage to the Greater Mexico City area and the deaths of at least 5,000 people. The sequence of events included a foreshock of magnitude 5.2 that occurred the prior May, the main shock on 19 September, and two large aftershocks. The first of these occurred on 20 September with a magnitude of 7.5 and the second occurred seven months later on 30 April 1986 with a magnitude of 7.0. They were located off the coast along the Middle America Trench, more than 350 kilometres (220 mi) away, but the city suffered major damage due to its large magnitude and the ancient lake bed that Mexico City sits on. The event caused between three and four billion USD in damage as 412 buildings collapsed and another 3,124 were seriously damaged in the city. At the time of the earthquake, Mexico was in its fourth year of a foreign debt crisis, and a contracting economy causing serious political problems for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Much of the PRI's authoritarian nature was tolerated because the country had seen four decades of economic expansion of six percent or better. When this disappeared, the PRI's power base began to shrink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009515;The Mexican Dirty War refers to the Mexican theater of the Cold War, an internal conflict in the 1960s and 1970s between the Mexican PRI-ruled government under the presidencies of Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, Luis Echeverria and Jose Lopez Portillo, which were backed by the US government, and left-wing student and guerrilla groups. The legalisation of left-wing political parties in 1978 along with the amnesty of imprisoned and at large guerrillas caused a number of combatants to end militant struggle against the government. However, certain groups continued fighting, and the National Human Rights Commission states the hostilities continued into 1982.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80095111;El Halconazo or The Corpus Christi Massacre (The hawk strike, so called because of the participation of a government-trained paramilitary group known as Los Halcones) was a massacre of student demonstrators during the Mexican Dirty War in Mexico City on 10 June 1971, the day of the Corpus Christi festival. Nearly 120 protesters were killed, among them a fourteen-year-old boy. The number of dead in the demonstration discouraged many students, but also led others to be radicalised, some of whom later formed urban guerrilla organisations. Students in 1971 especially demanded the democratisation of education, control of the university budget by students and teachers, and that it represent 12% of the GDP. They also demanded political freedom wherein workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals could enjoy real democratic freedoms and control the social system, quality education for everyone, especially farmers and workers, greater respect for cultural diversity, strict democratic transparency, and support for the political union of the workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009516;The 1988 Mexican general election was extremely important in Mexican history. The PRI's candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, an economist who was educated at Harvard, had never held an elected office, and who was a technocrat with no direct link to the legacy of the Mexican Revolution even through his family. Rather than toe the party line, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the son of former President Lazaro Cardenas, broke with the PRI and ran as a candidate of the Democratic Current, later forming into the Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). The PAN candidate Manuel Clouthier ran a clean campaign in long-standing pattern of the party. The election was marked by irregularities on a massive scale. The Ministry of the Interior (Gobernacion) controlled the electoral process, which meant in practice that the PRI controlled it. During the vote count, the government computers were said to have crashed, something the government called "a breakdown of the system". One observer said, "For the ordinary citizen, it was not the computer network but the Mexican political system that had crashed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009517;The Mexican peso crisis was a currency crisis sparked by the Mexican government's sudden devaluation of the peso against the U.S. dollar in December 1994, which became one of the first international financial crises ignited by capital flight. During the 1994 presidential election, the incumbent administration embarked on expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. Mexico enjoyed investor confidence and new access to international capital following its signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). However, a violent uprising in the state of Chiapas, as well as the assassination of the presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, resulted in political instability, causing investors to place an increased risk premium on Mexican assets. The central bank devalued the peso on December 20, 1994, and foreign investors' fear led to an even higher risk premium. To discourage the resulting capital flight, the bank raised interest rates, but higher costs of borrowing merely hurt economic growth. Unable to sell new issues of public debt or efficiently purchase dollars with devalued pesos, Mexico faced a default. Two days later, the bank allowed the peso to float freely, after which it continued to depreciate. In the aftermath of the crisis, several of Mexico's banks collapsed amidst widespread mortgage defaults. The Mexican economy experienced a severe recession and poverty and unemployment increased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009518;President Ernesto Zedillo oversaw political and electoral reforms that reduced the PRI's hold on power. After the 1988 election, which was strongly disputed and arguably lost by the government, the IFE (Instituto Federal Electoral - Federal Electoral Institute) was created in the early 1990s. Run by ordinary citizens, the IFE oversees elections with the aim of ensuring that they are conducted legally and impartially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009519;The Zapatista Army went public on January 1, 1994, releasing their declaration on the day the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect. On that day, they issued their First Declaration and Revolutionary Laws from the Lacandon Jungle. The declaration amounted to a declaration of war on the Mexican government, which they considered illegitimate. Their initial goal was to instigate a revolution against the rise of neoliberalism throughout Mexico, but since no such revolution occurred, they used their uprising as a platform to call attention to their movement to protest the signing of the NAFTA, which the EZLN believed would increase inequality in Chiapas. The EZLN did not demand independence from Mexico, preferring autonomy, land access, and use of natural resources normally extracted from Chiapas. It also advocated for protection from violence and political inclusion of Chiapas' indigenous communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8009520;Vicente Fox Quesada is a Mexican businessman and politician who served as the 55th President of Mexico from 1 December 2000 to 30 November 2006. Campaigning as a right-wing populist, Fox ran for and was elected president on the National Action Party (PAN) ticket, which was an opposition party at the time of his election as president. Fox was elected President of Mexico in the 2000 presidential election, a historically significant election since it made him the first president elected from an opposition party since the election of Francisco I. Madero in 1910. Fox finished in first place with 42 percent of the vote, thus becoming the first presidential candidate in 71 years to defeat the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). As president, he mostly followed the neoliberal economic policies that his predecessors from the PRI had adopted since the late 1980s. The first half of his administration saw a further shift of the Federal government to the right, strong relations with the United States and George W. Bush, unsuccessful attempts to apply a value-added tax to medicines and to build an airport in Texcoco, and a major diplomatic conflict with Cuban leader Fidel Castro.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8001817;The Cochabamba Water War was a series of protests that took place in Cochabamba, Bolivia's fourth largest city, between December 1999 and April 2000 in response to the privatisation of the city's municipal water supply company SEMAPA. The wave of demonstrations and police violence was described as a public uprising against water prices. The tensions erupted when a new firm, Aguas del Tunari - a joint venture involving Bechtel - was required to invest in construction of a long-envisioned dam (a priority of Mayor Manfred Reyes Villa) - so they had drastically raised water rates. Protests, largely organised through the Coordinadora in Defense of Water and Life, a community coalition, erupted in January, February, and April 2000, culminating in tens of thousands marching downtown and battling police. One civilian was killed. On 10 April 2000, the national government reached an agreement with the Coordinadora to reverse the privatisation. A complaint filed by foreign investors was resolved by agreement in February 2001.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On October 12, 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after sixteen people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes which erupted when a caravan of oil trucks escorted by police and soldiers deploying tanks and heavy-caliber machine guns tried to breach a barricade. On October 18, Sanchez de Lozada's governing coalition was fatally weakened when the New Republic Force party withdrew its support. He was forced to resign and was replaced by his vice president, Carlos Mesa, a former journalist. The strikes and roadblocks were lifted. On July 18, 2004, Mesa put the issue of gas nationalisation to a referendum. On May 6, 2005, the Bolivian Congress passed a new law raising taxes from 18% to 32% on profits made by foreign companies on the extraction of oil and gas. Mesa failed to either sign or veto the law, so by law Senate President Hormando Vaca Diez was required to sign it into law on May 17.

The proposal involved former Peruvian land and according to the treaty of Ancon, Chile could not give former Peruvian territories to other nations without Peru's agreement. The dictator of Peru Francisco Morales-Bermudez was opposed to these changes but proposed to make Arica a territory governed by the three states. Chile responded that it could not accept this complicated shared sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8012024;The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established by President Alejandro Toledo to investigate the human rights abuses committed during the Internal conflict in Peru between 1980s and 1990s. The TRC was a response to the violent internal conflict between 1980 and 2000 during the administration of Presidents Fernando Belaunde (1980-1985), Alan Garcia (1985-1990), and Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000). The commission's mandate was to provide a record of human rights and international humanitarian law violations committed in Peru between May 1980 and November 2000, as well as recommend mechanisms to promote and strengthen human rights. The TRC reported on the estimated 70,000 deaths, assassinations, torture, disappearances, displacement, employment of terrorist methods and other human rights violations executed by the State, Shining Path, and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. The report concluded that there is both institutional and individual accountability, as well as identifying racial and cultural factors that became a catalyst for conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012004;In 1945, Jose Bustamante had attained the presidency with the help of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA). Soon, major disagreements arose between Victor Raul Haya de la Torre, the founder of APRA, and President Bustamante. The President disbanded his Aprista cabinet and replaced it with a mostly military one. Odria, a fierce opponent of APRA, was appointed Minister of Government and Police. In 1948, Odria and other right-wing elements urged Bustamante to ban APRA. When the President refused, Odria resigned his post. On October 27, 1948, he led a successful military coup against the government and took over as president. After two years, he resigned and had one of his colleagues, Zenon Noriega, take office as a puppet president so he could run for president as a civilian. He was duly elected a month later as the only candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012007;Odria came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right. Like Juan Peron, he followed a populist course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, civil rights in the nation were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his regime. People feared that his dictatorship would run indefinitely, they were surprised when Odria legalized opposition parties in 1956 and called fresh elections. He did not run for office. He was succeeded by a former president, Manuel Prado.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012010;Belaunde ran for president once again in the national elections of 1962 with his own party, Accion Popular. The results were very tight and he ended in second place, following Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (APRA), by less than 14,000 votes. Since none of the candidates managed to get the constitutionally established minimum of one third of the vote required to win outright, selection of the President should have fallen to Congress. The long-held antagonistic relationship between the military and APRA prompted Haya de la Torre to make a deal with former dictator Odria, who had come in third, which would have resulted in Odria taking the Presidency in a coalition government. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by Ricardo Perez Godoy. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by Belaunde by a more comfortable but still narrow five percent margin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012011;Perez Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by Belaunde by a more comfortable but still narrow five percent margin. During Belaunde's first term in office, he spurred numerous developmental projects. These included the Carretera Marginal de la Selva, a much-needed highway linking Chiclayo on the Pacific coast with then isolated northern regions of Amazonas and San Martin. He also advanced the ambitious Santiago Antunez de Mayolo and Chira Piura irrigation projects, and the Tinajones, Jequetepeque, Majes, Chavimochic, Olmos, Chinecas hydroelectric projects. Belaunde also oversaw the establishment of the Peruvian National Bank. To alleviate poverty, Belaunde also promoted a program of "social interest" homes in Lima and other cities, which benefited dozen thousands of families.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012012;The MIR was born out of a split with the APRA, a formerly leftist group which increasingly began to collaborate with the government in the 1950s-60s. Following the 1963 election to the presidency of Fernando Belaunde Terry, and his failure to implement social reforms, the situation in the impoverished countryside became more critical. The first guerrilla movement, the ELN (National Liberation Army), appeared, but was quickly defeated by the military. 1964 was marked by the continuing failure of governmental reforms and clashes during land occupations by landless peasants, and the MIR launched its armed struggle the following year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012013;A dispute with the International Petroleum Company over licenses to the La Brea y Parinnas oil fields in Talara Province, northern Peru sparked a national scandal when a key page of a contract (the 11th) was found missing. The Armed Forces, fearing that this scandal might lead to another uprising or a takeover from the APRA party, seized absolute power and closed down Congress, almost all of whose members were briefly incarcerated. General Velasco seized power on October 3, 1968, in a bloodless military coup, deposing the democratically elected administration of Fernando Belaunde, under which he served as Commander of the Armed Forces. President Belaunde was sent into exile. Initial reaction against the coup evaporated after five days when on October 8, 1968, the oil fields in dispute were taken over by the Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012014;A root and branch education reform was in march looking to include all Peruvians and move them towards to a new national thinking and feeling. The education reform of 1972 provided for bilingual education for the indigenous people of the Andes and the Amazon, which consisted nearly half of the population. In 1975, the Velasco government enacted a law making Quechua an official language of Peru equal to Spanish. A cornerstone of Velasco's political and economic strategy was the implementation by dictate of an agrarian reform program to expropriate farms and diversify land ownership. Peru's agrarian reform under Velasco was the second-largest Land reform in Latin American history, after Cuba. The former landlords who opposed this program believed that they did not receive adequate compensation for their confiscated assets and lamented that the state officials and peasant beneficiaries mismanaged their properties after the expropriation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012015;Relations between the United States and Peru were tense and even hostile, beginning as soon as General Velasco and his junta took power. Just five days after Velasco seized power in 1968, the General began the nationalisation of the Peruvian Economy with the expropriation and nationalisation of the American International Petroleum Company (IPC) oil fields located in the northern Peruvian oil port and refinery of Talara, Piura, near the Peruvian border with Ecuador, Piura, being the region where Velasco was born. US-Peru disagreements continued over a broad range of issues including even Peru's claim to a 200-mile fishing limit that resulted in the seizure of several US commercial fishing boats and the expropriation of the American copper mining company Cerro de Pasco Corporation. General Velasco's other main goal besides the nationalization of the main areas of the Peruvian economy and the agrarial reforms, was to strengthen Peru militarily. Despite Chilean fears that Velasco planned on reconquering the lands lost by Peru to Chile in the 1879 War of the Pacific, this was not Velasco's intention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012016;Economic difficulties such as inflation, unemployment, food shortages and increased political opposition after the 1974 crackdown on the press ultimately increased pressures on the Velasco Administration and led to its downfall. General Francisco Morales Bermudez replaced Velasco in 1975, citing Velasco's economic mismanagement and deteriorating health. Morales Bermudez moved the revolution into a more conservative "second phase", tempering the radical measures of the first phase and beginning the task of restoring the country's economy. A constitutional assembly was created in 1979, which was led by Victor Raul Haya de la Torre. Morales Bermudez presided over the return to civilian government in accordance with a new constitution drawn up in 1979.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012017;The 1979 Constitution was promulgated on July 12, 1979 by a Constituent Assembly elected in June 1978 following 10 years of military rule and replaced the suspended 1933 Constitution. It became effective in 1980 with the re-election of deposed President Fernando Belaunde Terry. One of his first actions as President was the return of several newspapers to their respective owners. In this way, freedom of speech once again played an important part in Peruvian politics. Gradually, he attempted to undo some of the most radical effects of the Agrarian Reform initiated by Velasco, and reversed the independent stance that the Military Government of Velasco had with the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012018;When it first launched during the internal conflict in Peru in 1980, its goal was to overthrow the state by guerrilla warfare and replace it with a New Democracy. The Communist Party of Peru believed that by establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat, inducing a cultural revolution, and eventually sparking a world revolution, they could arrive at full communism. The Peruvian guerrillas were peculiar in that they had a high proportion of women. 50 per cent of the combatants and 40 per cent of the commanders were women. The Shining Path has been widely condemned for its brutality, including violence deployed against peasants, trade union organisers, elected officials and the general public. Since the capture of its leader Abimael Guzman in 1992, the Shining Path has declined in activity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012019;After a promising beginning, Belaunde's popularity eroded under the stress of inflation, economic hardship, and terrorism: per capita income declined, Peru's foreign debt burgeoned, and violence by leftist insurgents (notably Shining Path) rose steadily during the internal conflict in Peru, which was launched the day before Belaunde was elected in 1980. During the national elections of 1985, Belaunde's Party, Accion Popular, was defeated by APRA candidate Alan Garcia. However, as established in the 1979 Constitution, he would go on to serve in the Peruvian Senate as Senador Vitalicio ("senator for life"), a privilege for former Presidents abolished by the 1993 Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610109;The North American Free Trade Agreement was an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America. The agreement came into force on January 1, 1994, and superseded the 1988 Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada. Passage of NAFTA resulted in the elimination or reduction of barriers to trade and investment between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The effects of the agreement regarding issues such as employment, the environment, and economic growth have been the subject of political disputes. Most economic analyses indicated that NAFTA was beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen, but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This also gives the President the ability to issue executive orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_semi_presidential_title;Become a Semi-Presidential Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_semi_presidential_desc;A semi-presidential system or dual executive system is a system of government in which a president exists alongside a prime minister and a cabinet, with the latter being responsible to the legislature of the state. It differs from a parliamentary republic in that it has a popularly elected head of state, who is more than a mostly ceremonial figurehead, and from the presidential system in that the cabinet, although named by the president, is responsible to the legislature, which may force the cabinet to resign through a motion of no confidence. The President can dismiss and appoint a new Head of Government though this can lead to a constitutional crisis if the new party is not a majority party. The President can also be impeached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_parliamentary_system_title;Become a Parliamentary Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
become_parliamentary_system_desc;A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. The President cannot dismiss and appoint a new government and the government can only fall if there is a vote of no confidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is in light of the fact that the average militancy in $COUNTRY$ has dipped below 3 such that the draconian emergency powers are no longer needed. $MONARCHTITLE$, as we are only the Head of Government, we have two choices available to us - respect the Monarch's decision or to abolish the monarchy altogether.

The Asian Relations Conference brought together many leaders of the independence movements in Asia, and represented a first attempt to assert Asian unity. The objectives of the conference were "to bring together the leading men and women of Asia on a common platform to study the problems of common concern to the people of the continent, to focus attention on social, economic and cultural problems of the different countries of Asia, and to foster mutual contact and understanding.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Bialoguski introduced Petrov to a senior ASIO officer, Ron Richards, who offered Petrov asylum plus 5,000 pounds in exchange for all the documents he could bring with him from the embassy. Planning for Petrov's defection was codenamed Operation Cabin 12, after a briefer period of being designated Operation Cabin 11, following the standard practice of referring to potential defectors as "Cabin Candidates".

EVTDESC8010805;The Dhofar Rebellion was waged from 1962 to 1976 in the province of Dhofar against the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. The war began with the formation of the Dhofar Liberation Front, a group which aimed to create an independent state in Dhofar, free from the rule of the Omani Sultan Said bin Taimur. The rebels also held the broader goals of Arab nationalism which included the ending British influence in the Gulf region. The war initially took the form of a low level insurgency with guerrilla warfare being used against Omani forces and the foreign presence in the country. A number of factors such as the British withdrawal from Aden and support from China and the Soviet Union brought the rebels increased success, with the communists controlling the entirety of the Jebel region by the late 1960s. The 1970 Omani coup d'etat led to the overthrow of Sultan Said bin Taimur by his reformist son Qaboos bin Said who was backed by a major British military intervention in the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

sign_nuclear_test_ban_treaty_desc;핵무기는 전시에만 두번 쓰였으나 끔찍한 결과를 가져온 것으로 널리 알려져 있습니다. 종종 간과되는 것은 이러한 1945년 이후 최소 8개국이 2,000번 이상의 핵실험을 통해 다른 곳에서 이러한 핵무기를 '사용'했다는 사실입니다. 이러한 핵실험은 전세계 핵보유국들이 새로운 핵탄두 설계를 개발하고 핵무기 보유능력을 입증하는 데 쓰여왔습니다. 핵실험(특히 대기 중에서의 폭발)은 전 세계 수백만명의 생명과 건강에 부정적인 영향을 끼쳤습니다. 이에 대해 일반 시민, 과학자, 국회의원, 정부 지도자들은 세계적으로 검증 가능한 포괄적 핵실험 금지를 시행하기 위한 다단계적인 노력을 갈구해왔습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610089;포괄적 핵실험 금지 조약은 모든 환경에서 민간 및 군사적 목적의 모든 핵실험을 금지하는 다자간 조약입니다. 1996년 9월 10일 국제연합 총회에서 채택됐으나 특정 8개국이 이 조약을 비준하지 않았으므로 발효되지 않았습니다. 이후 수십년 동안의 지배적인 정치 상황으로 인해 1991년 냉전이 끝날 때까지 핵무기 군축은 거의 진전하지 않았습니다. 부분적 핵실험 금지 조약 당사국들은 1991년에 개정 회의를 열어 이 조약을 모든 핵무기 실험을 금지하는 것으로 바꾸자는 제안을 논의했습니다. 국제연합 총회의 강력한 지지로 1993년부터 포괄적 핵실험 금지 조약 협상이 시작됐습니다. 그 후 3년 동안 조약문 초안과 그 부속문서 두개를 작성하는 데 광범위한 노력이 있었습니다. 1996년 9월 10일 포괄적 핵실험 금지 조약이 총회 회원국의 3분의 2를 초과하는 다수결로 채택됐습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC124156;국민정신은 $COUNTRY$ 국민들이 소중히 여기는 공통의 가치를 나타냅니다. 국민들은 질서, 평등, 법적 자유, 전통, 실력, 진보를 중시합니다. 국민정신은 대중적 다수 이념과 현재 여당 이념에 따라 달라질 수 있습니다. 조건을 충족하면 국민정신 변경에 약 3년이 소요됩니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC124150;보수주의는 문화와 문명의 맥락에서 전통적인 사회제도를 옹호하는 정치/사회 철학입니다. 보수주의의 중심에는 전통, 유기적 사회, 계급, 권위, 재산권이 있습니다. 보수주의자는 사회 안정과 연속성을 강조하기 위해 종교, 내각책임제, 재산권과 같은 다양한 제도들을 보존하려고 합니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC124151;넓은 의미의 자유란 마음대로 할 수 있는 능력입니다. 현대 정치에서 자유는 '권위가 자신의 생활방식, 행동 또는 정치적 견해에 부과하는 억압적인 제한을 벗어나 사회 내에서 통제를 받지 않는 상태'입니다. 때로는 자연적 자유라는 단어를 사용함으로써 자유라는 단어를 법적 자유라는 단어와 구별하기도 합니다. 자연적 자유는 '자신의 의지대로 행할 수 있는 능력과 자신이 행할 수 있는 힘'을 의미하며, 이렇게 자유를 구별하는 이유는 '임의적인 구속의 부재'를 의미하는 법적 자유와 구분함으로써 둘을 구별하기 위함입니다. 이런 의미에서 자유의 행사는 능력의 대상이며 타인의 권리에 제한됩니다. 따라서 법적 자유는 다른 사람의 자유를 빼앗지 않고 법의 지배 아래 자연적 자유의 책임감 있는 사용을 수반합니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC124155;19세기 후반 서구 세계에서 정치적 견해가 인기를 얻었습니다. 부자와 빈자 사이의 거대한 경제적 불평등, 통제 불능의 독점적 기업들과 최소한의 규제를 받는 자유방임주의, 노동자와 자본가들 사이의 격렬하고 종종 폭력적인 갈등, 이러한 문제들을 해결하기 위한 대책의 필요성으로 인해 진보가 억제된다는 것입니다. 진보주의는 다양한 정치 운동에 영향을 미쳤습니다. 현대에 와서 진보를 자칭하는 운동은 '정치적 변화와 정부 행동의 지지를 통해 서민의 이익을 대변하고자 하는 사회 또는 정치 운동'을 가리킵니다. 통일된 주제는 현재의 제도나 행동방식의 부정적인 영향에 대한 관심을 환기하고 진보에 대한 지지, 즉 민주주의의 확대, 사회적/경제적 평등 증가, 인구의 안녕 향상 등과 같은 여러 기준에 따라 정의된 긍정적인 변화를 위한 것입니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1610061;1930년대부터 1980년대 후반까지 남아메리카 국가 대부분은 수입대체산업화정책을 채택했습니다. 그 시작점은 대공황으로, 주로 농산물 등의 1차산업이 수출의 대부분을 차지하고 공산품의 거의 전량을 수입하던 남아메리카 국가들에 대해 외국의 공산품 판매량이 급감해 공산품을 수입할 길이 막혔기 때문입니다. 이러한 사건은 자신들이 필요로 하는 물품을 국내에서 생산해야 한다고 느끼는 동기로 작용했습니다. 수입대체산업화는 아르헨티나의 경제학자이자 라틴아메리카 카리브 경제위원회의 대표인 라울 프레비쉬와 브라질의 경제학자 세우수 푸르타두 등이 이 개념의 가시적인 지지자가 된 1950년대에야 이론적 기반을 얻었습니다. 자국 중앙은행을 운영한 경험이 있던 프레비쉬는 수출주도성장에 의문을 제기하기 시작했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1610062;수입대체산업화정책으로 인한 상품 수입은 외환보유액의 급속한 고갈로 이어졌습니다. 국제통화기금의 지도 아래 태환 통제가 다시 이뤄진 1947년, 크루즈를 미국 화폐에 비해 높은 수준으로 유지했습니다. 이 정책은 반대로 소비재를 제외한 장비, 기계, 기타 투입물품의 수입을 장려하고, 수출을 위축시켰으며 제조업의 확대를 선호했습니다. 정부의 발전 전략은 보건, 음식, 교통, 에너지를 강조하기 위해 이름붙은 '부지 계획'을 포함했습니다. 1947년에 제안된 이 계획은 국가의 주요 부문에 대한 공공 지출과 투자의 관리를 목표로 했지만 1949년에야 예산을 통해 자금을 받기 시작했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC201903;한때 세계 군주들에게 중요한 의식이었던 대관식은 시간이 지나면서 다양한 사회/정치/종교적인 요소들로 바뀌었습니다. 현대에 이르러서는 대부분의 군주들이 더 간단한 의식을 선호하면서 이러한 대관식을 대부분 생략해왔습니다. 과거에, 왕족, 대관식, 신에 대한 개념은 종종 터무니없이 서로 이어져 있었습니다. 일부 고대 문화권에서는 통치자들이 전체적, 부분적으로 신이라고 여겼습니다. 이를테면 이집트에서는 파라오가 태양의 신 라의 아들이라고 여겼고, 일본에서는 천황이 태양의 여신 아마테라스의 후손이라 여겼습습니다. 로마는 황제 숭배의 관행을 공포했고, 중세 유럽에서는 군주들이 신에게서 통치에 대한 권리를 하사받았다고 주장했습니다. 대관식은 한때 이러한 연관성을 직접적으로 드러내는 시각적 표현이었지만, 최근 수세기 동안 이러한 믿음은 꾸준히 감소해왔습니다. 여전히 대관식을 벌이는 나라로는 영국, 통가, 아시아와 아프리카 일부 국가들이 있습니다. 유럽에서는 대부분의 군주들이 입법부 앞에서 간단한 선서만을 합니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1512343;덴마크에 속하는 보른홀름은 1940년 4월 10일 독일에 점령된 이래로 동부전선의 일부로서 망루 및 청음소 역할을 했습니다. 독일과 스웨덴 사이, 발트해의 완벽한 중앙이라는 섬의 입지는 이 섬이 중요한 '자연요새'임을 의미했고, 실제로도 효과적으로 잠수함이나 구축함이 독일군에게 접근하지 못하게 했습니다. 5월 9일 섬에 상륙한 소련군은 짧은 싸움 끝에 독일 수비대(약 12,000명 강)의 항복을 받아냈습니다. 그리고 1946년 4월 5일에 소련군은 섬을 떠났습니다. 보른홀름에서 병력을 철수시킨 후 소련은 '보른홀름에서의 외국군 주둔은 소련에 대한 선전포고로 간주하겠으며, 덴마크는 그러한 외국의 침략에게서 군대를 보호하기 위해 항상 섬에 군대를 주둔시켜야 한다'는 입장을 취했습니다. 이 정책은 북대서양 조약기구에 덴마크가 창립국으로 참가한 후에도 그대로 이어졌습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1512341;칼리닌그라드, 즉 쾨니히스베르크는 2차 세계대전 이전 수세기 동안 독일의 일부로 기능해왔습니다. 이 도시는 역사적으로 독일의 철학자 임마누엘 칸트의 본거지로서 독일의 풍부한 문화중심지였습니다. 동프로이센의 쾨니히스베르크 지역을 러시아에 편입시킨 것은 1943년 12월 테헤란 회의에서 소련의 명시적인 전쟁목표가 되었기 때문입니다. 1945년 제2차 세계대전이 끝날 무렵 소련군은 이 도시를 점령했고,  포츠담 회의에서 연합군이 합의한 대로 쾨니히스베르크를 포함한 프로이센 북부를 병합했습니다. 참고로 동프로이센의 남부는 폴란드가 차지했습니다. 1946년 소련은 도시의 이름을 칼리닌그라드로 바꾸었습니다. 1950년대 니키타 흐루쇼프는 리투아니아에게 칼리닌그라드주의 합병을 제안했으나, 공화국의 민족 구성을 바꾸고 싶지 않았던 리투아니아 공산당 대표 안타나스 스니에치쿠스는 이 제안을 거부했습니다. 슈피겔이 2010년에 발표한 기사에 따르면 1990년 소련 장군 겔리 바테닌이 서독 정부에게 칼리닌그라드의 반환을 제안하는 전신을 보냈다고 합니다. 당시 동독과의 통일을 우선시했던 서독 정부는 이 제안을 대수롭지 않게 넘겼다고 합니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8015821;트럼프가 공화당 경선 후보들을 따돌리고 폭넓은 분야에서 선두로 부상한 가운데, 클린턴도 버니 샌더스 상원의원을 누르고 미국 주요 정당의 첫 여성 대통령 후보가 됐습니다. '미국을 다시 위대하게 만들겠다'고 약속하고 정치적 올바름, 불법 이민, 수많은 자유무역협정에 반대했던 트럼프의 대중주의/민족주의적 선거운동은 언론을 타고 광범위하게 퍼져나갔습니다. 클린턴은 자신의 정치 경험을 강조하고 트럼프와 그의 지지자들을 편협한 존재라고 비난하며 오바마 대통령 정책의 연장, 소수인종/성소수자/여성의 권리 확대, '포괄적 자본주의'를 주장했습니다. 대선의 기조는 크게 편가르기과 네거티브로 요약할 수 있겠습니다. 트럼프는 인종 및 이민에 대한 견해, 집회에서의 시위대에 대한 폭력사건, 성적 부정행위에 대한 논란에 직면했고 클린턴은 지지율 하락과 개인 이메일 서버를 부적절하게 이용했다는 연방경찰의 조사에 시달렸습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015820;현직 대통령으로서 오바마는 심각한 반대 없이 민주당의 지명을 확보했습니다. 한편 공화당은 경쟁적인 경선을 경험했습니다. 롬니는 일관되게 여론조사에서 경쟁력을 갖추었으며 많은 정당 지도자들의 지지를 받았지만, 보수 진영 주자들에게서 수많은 도전을 받았습니다. 그렇지만 결국 롬니는 릭 산토룸, 뉴트 깅리치 등의 후보들을 물리치고 공화당의 지명을 확정했습니다. 선거운동은 국내의 쟁점에 집중됐고, 토론은 주로 대반전에 대한 건전한 반응에 초점이 맞춰졌습니다. 다른 문제들로는 장기적인 연방 예산 문제, 사회보험사업의 미래, 그리고 오바마의 미숙한 입법계획인 '경제적 관리법'이 있었습니다. 이라크 전쟁의 단계적 중단과 군비 지출, 이란 핵실험, 적절한 대테러대응 등 외교 정책도 논의했습니다. 선거운동은 명목상 독립적인 정치활동위원회를 포함한 모금액이 급증한 것으로 요약할 수 있습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015819;조지 W. 부시 대통령은 수정헌법 22조의 임기 제한 규정으로 인해 3선을 추진할 자격이 없었습니다. 민주당 경선은 오바마와 초기 선두 주자인 힐러리 클린턴 상원의원의 치열한 경합으로 두드러졌습니다. 뉴햄프셔 프라이머리에서 클린턴이 거둔 승리는 그녀를 주요 정당의 대통령 예비선거에서 이긴 첫 여성으로 만들었습니다. 오랜 경선 끝에 2008년 6월 오바마가 민주당 후보로 확정됐습니다. 초기 선거운동은 이라크 전쟁과 부시의 인기 없는 행동에 초점을 맞췄습니다. 매케인은 2007년부터 시작된 병력증강뿐 아니라 전쟁도 함께 지지했고, 오바마는 전쟁에 강하게 반대했습니다. 부시는 매케인을 지지했지만 두 사람은 함께 선거운동을 하지 않았고, 부시는 2008년 공화당 전당대회에 직접 모습을 드러내지 않았습니다. 오바마는 '워싱턴은 달라져야 한다'는 주제로 선거운동을 벌였고, 매케인은 자신의 경험을 강조했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015818;부시 대통령과 딕 체니 부통령은 아무런 어려움 없이 당의 지명을 재차 받았습니다. 하워드 딘 전 주지사는 2004년 민주당 경선에서 초반 선두로 떠올랐지만 2004년 1월 첫 경선의 승자는 케리 후보였습니다. 결국 3월 케리가 연이은 경선 승리 끝에 당 대표 지명을 확정했습니다. 케리 후보는 2004년 대선 후보 지명을 추진했던 존 에드워즈 노스캐롤라이나 상원의원을 부통령 후보로 선정했습니다. 부시의 인기는 9.11 테러 이후 첫 임기 초반에 치솟았지만 2001년부터 2004년에 걸쳐 지속적으로 감소했습니다. 부시는 자신을 단호한 지도자로 내세우며 케리를 '거짓말쟁이'라고 공격했고, 케리는 부시의 이라크전 행태를 비난했습니다. 경제와 일자리, 의료, 낙태, 동성결혼, 배아줄기세포 연구 등 국내 문제도 논의했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015817;텍사스 주지사이자 41대 대통령의 장남인 공화당의 조지 W. 부시 후보가 현직 부통령인 민주당 앨 고어 후보를 누르고 대통령에 당선됐습니다. 일반 투표에서 패배하고 선거인단 선거에서 승리한 다섯명의 대통령 중에서 가장 최근의 선거로 꼽힙니다. 부시는 공화당의 후보 지명에서 초기 후보로 여겨졌으나, 존 매케인 상원의원과 다른 후보들과의 논쟁에도 불구하고 슈퍼 화요일까지 후보 지명을 확보했습니다. 두 주요 정당 후보 모두 대외정책은 무시하지 않을 정도로 거론했고, 예산과 세제감면, 연방사회보험제도 개혁 등 국내 쟁점에 주로 집중했습니다. 클린턴의 모니카 르윈스키와의 성추문과 그에 따른 탄핵으로 고어는 클린턴과의 선거운동을 피할 수 있었습니다. 공화당은 클린턴의 경솔함을 비난했고 고어는 부시의 경험 부족을 비난했습니다. 선거 당일 밤, 플로리다의 선거인단이 아직 결정되지 않은 가운데 누가 이겼는지 불분명했습니다. 그 결과는 부시가 플로리다에서 아주 근소한 차이로 이겼음을 보여주었고 주법원은 재검표를 요구하였습니다. 한달 동안 이어진 법정 공방은 5차례로 이어졌고, 대법원이 부시의 승리를 판결하면서 재검표는 끝났습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015816;클린턴과 앨 고어 부통령은 별다른 사건 없이 민주당의 재지명을 받았습니다. 공화당에서는 많은 후보들이 1996년 예비선거에 참여했고, 초기에는 돌이 선두주자로 꼽혔습니다. 돌은 스티브 포브스 출판사의 관리자인 팻 뷰캐넌의 도전을 물리친 후 지명됐습니다. 돌은 전 하원의원이자 축구선수이며 조지 H. W. 부시 대통령 밑에서 주택비서를 지낸 잭 켐프를 부통령 후보로 지명했습니다. 1992년 선거에서는 무소속 후보로 18.9퍼센트의 지지를 얻었던 로스 페롯도 개혁당 후보로 출마했습니다. 그러나 페롯은 언론의 주목을 덜 받았고, 대선 토론회에서도 제외당했습니다. 당초 민주당이 1994년 수십년 만에 하원과 상원을 모두 잃자 세간에서는 클린턴의 당선 가능성이 희박하다고 생각했습니다. 다만 비교적 안정된 세계화 덕분에 1990년대 초반의 불황에서 경제가 회복되기 시작하면서 클린턴은 다시 입지를 굳힐 수 있었습니다. 돌은 연방 소득세를 15퍼센트 인하할 것을 약속하고 클린턴을 '폐급' 베이비붐 세대의 일원이라고 공격했습니다. 돌의 나이는 선거에서 끈질긴 쟁점이었고, 돌의 실수는 선거운동 내에서 이 쟁점을 악화하고 말았습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015815;빌 클린턴 아칸소 주지사가 현 공화당 대통령 조지 H. W. 부시, 무소속 사업가 로스 페로, 다수의 군소 후보들을 물리쳤습니다. 부시는 1988년 선거 공약인 세금 인상에 반대함으로써 당내의 많은 보수주의자들을 소외시켰지만, 보수 논객인 팻 뷰캐넌의 1차 도전을 물리쳤습니다. 걸프 전쟁 승전 이래 부시의 인기는 마리오 쿠오모 같은 유명 민주당 후보들이 1992년 민주당 예비선거 참여를 단념하게끔 만들 정도였습니다. 중도파 민주지도부협의회의 대표인 클린턴은 슈퍼 화요일 예비선거를 휩쓸며 민주당 공천 선두주자로 자리매김했습니다. 억만장자 로스 페롯은 북미자유무역협정 반대와 국가채무 축소 계획을 강조하며 독자적인 선거운동을 시작했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8015814;1988년 제51회 미국 대통령 선거는 4년마다 실시되는 대통령 선거로 1988년 11월 8일 화요일에 열렸습니다. 공화당 후보인 조지 H.

"68 혁명"은 이후 수십년간 프랑스 사회에 영향을 미쳤고 오늘날까지도 문화적, 사회적, 도덕적 전환점으로 여겨집니다. 알랭 가이스마가 지적했듯이, 이 운동은 "정치적 혁명이 아닌 사회 혁명으로서" 성공을 거두었습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

one_child_policy_mod;계획생육정책 효과;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1512219;The one-child policy was part of a birth planning program designed to control the size of its population. Distinct from the family planning policies of most other countries, it set a limit on the number of children parents could have, the world's most extreme example of population planning. It was introduced in 1979, modified in the mid 1980s to allow rural parents a second child if the first was a daughter, and then lasted three more decades before being eliminated at the end of 2015. The policy also allowed exceptions for some other groups, including ethnic minorities. The term one-child policy is thus a misnomer, because for nearly 30 years of the 36 years that it existed (1979-2015) about half of all parents in China were allowed to have a second child. Provincial governments could (and did) require the use of contraception, sterilisations and abortions to ensure compliance and imposed enormous fines for violations. Local and national governments created commissions to raise awareness and carry out registration and inspection work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1512200;전후 국제 유대관계가 확대되면서 몽골은 북한 및 동유럽의 신생 공산국가들과 대외관계를 맺었습니다. 몽골과 중화인민공화국은 1949년에 서로를 인정했고, 중화인민공화국은 외몽골에 대한 모든 영유권 주장을 포기했습니다. 1952년 처이발상이 모스크바에서 암 치료를 받다가 사망했습니다. 그의 지위는 윰자김 체덴발 총리가 계승했습니다. 그는 처이발상과는 달리 몽골을 소련의 구성 공화국으로 통합하는 방안에 열광했습니다. 그러나 다른 몽골 인민혁명당원들의 격렬한 반대에 부딪히면서 버려졌습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1512199;새로운 문서를 채택함에 있어서 메이지 헌법은 위반적이지 않으며, 오히려 법적 연속성을 유지하기로 결정했습니다. 따라서 1946년 헌법은 제73조의 규정에 따라 메이지 헌법의 개정안으로서 채택되었습니다. 제73조에 따라 새 헌법은 6월 20일에 천황이 발표한 칙령을 통해 공식적으로 제국의회에 제출되었습니다. 헌법 초안은 제국헌법 개정안으로 제출되어 심의를 받았습니다. 당시 제국헌법은 법안이 국회 양원에서 3분의 2의 지지를 받아야만 비로소 법률로 제정할 수 있도록 정했습니다. 양회 모두 동료의원이 이 문서를 수정한 10월 6일 이후 하원은 다음 날 같은 형태로 이 문서를 채택했고, 단 5명의 의원만이 반대표를 던졌고, 1946년 11월 3일 천황의 승인을 받음으로써 비로소 헌법이 되었습니다. 그 자체의 조건에 따라 헌법은 1947년 5월 3일에 발효했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1512197;프랑스 연합은 프랑스 제4공화국이 프랑스 식민제도를 대체하기 위해 만든 정치적 실체로, 구어적으로는 "프랑스 식민제국"으로 알려져 있습니다. 프랑스 연합은 식민지 내 프랑스 신민들의 "원주민" 지위가 공식적으로 사라지는 결과를 낳았습니다. 이 연합의 목표는 "해외 영토를 프랑스 시민들이 거주하고 프랑스 문화가 축복하는 더 큰 프랑스로 동화하기"였습니다(반면 영국 식민제도는 결국 독자적 국가로 진화할 지방 총독부를 운영했음). 프랑스는 단일 프랑스인 국가 하에 단일정부를 만들기를 원했습니다. 사실 식민지도 대표가 있었지만 모든 권력은 프랑스 의회에 남아있는 등 중앙집권적이었습니다. 식민지들도 지역집단이 있었으나 제한적인 권력만을 가졌습니다. 대신 프랑스 본토에서 해외 영토 출신의 여러 원주민들이 엘리트 집단으로 성장했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1512196;1992년 9월 16일 영국에서 검은 수요일이 발생했습니다. 당시 유럽 환율조정제도에서 합의한 하한선 이상으로 파운드화를 유지할 수 없게 되면서 존 메이저의 보수당 내각은 파운드화를 회수해야 했습니다. 1997년 영국 재무부는 검은 수요일의 비용을 4억파운드로 추산했습니다. 1990년대 초부터 독일 통일로 인한 초과 지출과 관련된 인플레이션에 시달리던 독일 연방은행이 금리를 높게 잡으면서 환율조정제도 전체가 상당한 스트레스를 받아야 했습니다. 영국과 이탈리아는 이중 적자로 인해 추가적인 어려움을 겪었고, 영국은 추가적으로 그 해 여름 미국 달러화의 급속한 평가절하로 인해 많은 영국 수출품이 타격을 입었습니다. 국가 위신 차원의 문제들과 환율조정제도 내에서 환율을 고정하면 유럽 단일통화로 향하리라는 교리에 대한 확신은 환율 조정을 억제했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1512195;유럽 환율조정제도는 1979년 3월 13일 유럽 경제공동체에서 유럽 통화제도의 일환으로 도입한 제도로, 1999년 1월 1일에 발효할 경제적 통화연합 및 단일통화인 유로화 도입에 대비해 환율 변동을 줄이고 유럽의 통화 안정을 달성한다는 목적을 가졌습니다. 환율조정제도는 기준통화 환율 차이 개념에 기반했으나 환율 변동은 그 차이 안에서 일어납니다. 이를 준연동제라고도 합니다. 유로화 도입 전 환율은 유럽화폐단위에 근거해 참가 통화의 가중평균으로서 가치가 정해졌습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1512194;1말레이시아 개발회사 사건은 말레이시아에서 일어난 정치적 추문입니다. 2015년 나집 라작 말레이시아 총리는 정부 산하 전략개발회사인 1말레이시아 개발회사에서 개인은행 계좌로 약 7억달러를 대출한 혐의를 받고 있습니다. 수많은 말레이시아인들이 이 사건을 비난했으며, 전임 총리인 마하티르 모하메드 박사를 포함한 수많은 사람들이 나집 라작의 사임을 요구했습니다. 그 결과 2018년 총선의 결과로서 그는 나집을 물리치고 정권을 되찾았습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1512190;1990년 대선에서 후지모리가 '캄비오(외국통화교환소) 90'의 기치 아래 세계적인 작가 마리오 바르가스 요사에게서 깜짝 역전승을 거둬 다크호스 후보로 당선됐습니다. 그는 퇴임하는 알란 가르시아 대통령, 아메리카 대중혁명동맹당에 대한 깊은 환멸을 이용했습니다. 그는 바르가스 로사의 기존 페루 정치조직과의 정체성에 대한 대중의 불신과 신자유주의적 경제개혁 계획에 대한 불확실성을 이용했습니다. 선거운동 기간 동안 후지모리는 대략 엘 치노(중국인)라는 별명을 얻었습니다. 후지모리는 일본계였으나, 자신은 항상 이 애정의 말로 인식되는 용어에 더 흥분한다고 밝혀왔습니다. 그는 라틴아메리카 국가의 정부 수장에 오른 두번째 동아시아인이기도 합니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1512191;후지모리의 첫 임기 동안 아메리카 대중혁명동맹당과 바르가스 로사의 민주전선은 의회와 하원, 상원을 모두 장악하면서 경제개혁 제정을 방해했습니다. 후지모리는 또한 의회에서의 비타협적이고 방해적인 요소로 인해 떠오르는 마오주의 반군 유격대 진압에 어려움을 겪었습니다. 1992년 3월까지 의회에 대해 단지 17퍼센트의 유권자만이 괜찮다고 밝혔습니다. 한 여론조사에 따르면 당시 대통령의 지지율은 42퍼센트였습니다. 1992년 4월 5일 정치적 교착상태에 대응하고자 하던 후지모리는 군부의 지원을 받아 친위정변을 단행해 의회를 폐쇄하고 헌법을 정지하고 사법부를 숙청했습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1512192;1996년 12월 17일 페루 리마에서 투팍 아마루 혁명운동 조직원 14명이 페루 주재 일본 대사 아오키의 관저에서 열린 아키히토 천황의 63번째 생일을 축하하는 행사에 참석 중이던 고위 외교관, 정부 및 군 관계자, 기업 간부 수백명을 인질로 잡았습니다. 이후 126일 동안 인질로 잡혀있던 고위 인사들은 1997년 4월 22일 페루 국군 특공대의 습격으로 풀려났고, 이 과정에서 인질 1명, 특공대원 2명, 투팍 아마루 혁명운동 무장대원 전원이 살해당했습니다. 대부분의 페루 사람들은 이 작전을 대성공으로 인식했으며, 전세계 언론의 주목을 받았습니다. 알베르토 후지모리 대통령은 처음에 인질들의 생명을 구해준 공로를 인정받았습니다. 그 후 다수의 반란자들이 항복한 후 즉시 처형당했다고 주장하는 보도가 나왔습니다.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1512193;2000년 페루는 4월 9일 총선, 5월 28일 대통령 선거의 2차 투표를 치렀습니다. 그러나 사기 행각을 벌였다며 많은 논란을 일으켰습니다. 알베르토 후지모리 대통령이 선거에서 승리하고 3선 연임에 성공했으나, 이번 선거는 위헌, 뇌물, 구조적 편견, 노골적인 선거 사기로 얼룩졌습니다. 알레한드로 톨레도는 30퍼센트가 넘는 투표용지를 무효로 선언한 2차 대선 투표를 보이콧했습니다. 궁극적으로 후지모리는 새로운 선거를 요구하고 페루를 탈출했으며, 일본의 한 호텔에서 사임하겠다는 팩스를 보냈습니
